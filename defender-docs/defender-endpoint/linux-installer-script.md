# Use installer script based deployment to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for servers
- Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2

## Introduction

You can deploy [Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md) by using various tools and methods. This article describes how to automate the deployment of Defender for Endpoint on Linux by using an installer script. This script identifies the distribution and version, selects the right repository, sets up the device to pull the latest agent version, and onboards the device to Defender for Endpoint using the onboarding package. This method is highly recommended for simplifying the deployment process.

To use another method, refer to the [See also](#see-also) section. 

[!INCLUDE [side-by-side-scenarios](includes/side-by-side-scenarios.md)]

## Prerequisites and system requirements

Before you get started, see [Prerequisites for Defender for Endpoint on Linux](mde-linux-prerequisites.md) for a description of prerequisites and system requirements.

## Deployment process

1. Download the onboarding package from Microsoft Defender portal by following these steps:

   1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.
    
   2. In the first drop-down menu, select **Linux Server** as the operating system.
   
   3. In the second drop-down menu, select **Local Script** as the deployment method.
    
   4. Select **Download onboarding package**. Save the file as `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`.
   
      :::image type="content" source="media/linux-script-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the options to select to download the onboarding package." lightbox="media/linux-script-image.png":::
    
   5. From a command prompt, extract the contents of the archive:

      ```bash
      unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
      ```

      ```console
      Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
      inflating: MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py
      ```

      > [!WARNING]
      > Repackaging the Defender for Endpoint installation package isn't a supported scenario. Doing so can negatively affect the integrity of the product and lead to adverse results, including but not limited to triggering tampering alerts and updates failing to apply. 

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If you miss this step, any command executed shows a warning message indicating that the product is unlicensed. Also the mdatp health command returns a value of false. 

2. Download the [installer bash script](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh) provided in our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/).

3. Grant executable permissions to the installer script:
  
   ```bash
   chmod +x mde_installer.sh
   ```

4. Execute the installer script and provide the onboarding package as a parameter to install the agent and onboard the device to the Defender portal.

   ```bash
   sudo ./mde_installer.sh --install --onboard ./MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py --channel prod --min_req
   ```
   
   This command deploys the latest agent version to the production channel, check for min system requisites and onboard the device to Defender Portal.

   Additionally you can pass more parameter based on your requirements to modify the installation. Check help for all the available options:

   ```bash
    ❯ ./mde_installer.sh --help
   mde_installer.sh v0.7.0
   usage: basename ./mde_installer.sh [OPTIONS]
   Options:
   -c|--channel         specify the channel(insiders-fast / insiders-slow / prod) from which you want to install. Default: prod
   -i|--install         install the product

   -o|--onboard         onboard the product with <onboarding_script>
   -f|--offboard        offboard the product with <offboarding_script>
   -p|--passive-mode    set real time protection to passive mode
   -a|--rtp-mode        set real time protection to active mode. passive-mode and rtp-mode are mutually exclusive
   -t|--tag             set a tag by declaring <name> and <value>, e.g: -t GROUP Coders
   -m|--min_req         enforce minimum requirements
   -x|--skip_conflict   skip conflicting application verification
   -w|--clean           remove repo from package manager for a specific channel
   -y|--yes             assume yes for all mid-process prompts (default, deprecated)
   -n|--no              remove assume yes sign
   -s|--verbose         verbose output
   -v|--version         print out script version
   -d|--debug           set debug mode
   --log-path <PATH>    also log output to PATH
   --http-proxy <URL>   set http proxy

   |Downgrade to a specific agent version | `sudo ./mde_installer.sh --downgrade –-mdatp 101.24082.0004` |
   |Uninstall agent | `sudo ./mde_installer.sh --remove` |
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Upgrading your operating system to a new major version after the product installation requires the product to be reinstalled. You need to uninstall the existing Defender for Endpoint on Linux, upgrade the operating system, and then reconfigure Defender for Endpoint on Linux.

## Verify deployment status

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), open the device inventory. It might take 5-20 minutes for the device to show up in the portal.

2. Run an antivirus detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

   1. Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of `true` from running the following command):

      ```bash
      mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
      ```

      If it isn't enabled, execute the following command:

      ```bash
      mdatp config real-time-protection --value enabled
      ```
   1. Open a Terminal window and execute the following command to run a detection test: 

      ```bash
      curl -o /tmp/eicar.com.txt https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
      ```

   1. You can run more detection tests on zip files using either of the following commands: 
     
      ```bash
      curl -o /tmp/eicar_com.zip https://secure.eicar.org/eicar_com.zip
      curl -o /tmp/eicarcom2.zip https://secure.eicar.org/eicarcom2.zip
      ```

   1. The files should be quarantined by Defender for Endpoint on Linux. Use the following command to list all the detected threats: 

      ```bash
      mdatp threat list
      ```

1. Run an EDR detection test and simulate a detection to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

   1. Download and extract the [script file](https://aka.ms/MDE-Linux-EDR-DIY) to an onboarded Linux server.
      
   1. Grant executable permissions to the script:
   
      ```bash
      chmod +x mde_linux_edr_diy.sh
      ```
      
   1. Run the following command: 

      ```bash
      ./mde_linux_edr_diy.sh
      ```
      
   3. After a few minutes, a detection should be raised in the Microsoft Defender XDR.
   
   4. Check the alert details, machine timeline, and perform your typical investigation steps.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint package external package dependencies

If the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint installation fails due to missing dependencies errors, you can manually download the required dependencies.

The following external package dependencies exist for the `mdatp` package:

- The `mdatp RPM` package requires - `glibc >= 2.17`
- For DEBIAN the `mdatp` package requires `libc6 >= 2.23`
- For Mariner the `mdatp` package requires `attr`,`diffutils`, `libacl`, `libattr`,`libselinux-utils`, `selinux-policy`, `policycoreutils`

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning with version `101.24082.0004`, Defender for Endpoint on Linux no longer supports the `Auditd` event provider. We're transitioning completely to the more efficient eBPF technology. 
> If `eBPF` isn't supported on your machines, or if there are specific requirements to remain on `Auditd`, and your machines are using Defender for Endpoint on Linux version `101.24072.0001` or earlier, other dependencies on the auditd package exist for `mdatp`.
> For version older than `101.25032.0000`:
> - RPM package needs: `mde-netfilter`, `pcre`
> - DEBIAN package needs: `mde-netfilter`, `libpcre3`
> - The `mde-netfilter` package also has the following package dependencies:
    - For DEBIAN, the mde-netfilter package requires `libnetfilter-queue1` and `libglib2.0-0`
    - For RPM, the mde-netfilter package requires `libmnl`, `libnfnetlink`, `libnetfilter_queue`, and `glib2`
> Beginning with version `101.25042.0003`, uuid-runtime is no longer required as an external-dependency.

## Troubleshoot installation issues

If you experience any installation issues, for self-troubleshooting, follow these steps:

1. For information on how to find the log that's generated automatically when an installation error occurs, see [Log installation issues](linux-resources.md#log-installation-issues).

2. For information about common installation issues, see [Installation issues](/defender-endpoint/linux-support-install).

3. If health of the device is `false`, see [Defender for Endpoint agent health issues](/defender-endpoint/health-status).

4. For product performance issues, see [Troubleshoot performance issues](/defender-endpoint/linux-support-perf).

5. For proxy and connectivity issues, see [Troubleshoot cloud connectivity issues](/defender-endpoint/linux-support-connectivity).

To get support from Microsoft, open a support ticket, and provide the log files created by using the [client analyzer](/defender-endpoint/overview-client-analyzer).

## How to switch between channels

For example, to change channel from Insiders-Fast to Production, do the followings:

1. Uninstall the `Insiders-Fast channel` version of Defender for Endpoint on Linux.

   ```bash
   sudo yum remove mdatp
   ```

2. Disable the Defender for Endpoint on Linux Insiders-Fast repo.

   ```bash
   sudo yum repolist
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The output should show `packages-microsoft-com-fast-prod`.

   ```bash
   sudo yum-config-manager --disable packages-microsoft-com-fast-prod
   ```

3. Redeploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux using the Production channel.

Defender for Endpoint on Linux can be deployed from one of the following channels (denoted as [channel]): 

- `insiders-fast`
- `insiders-slow`
- `prod` 

Each of these channels corresponds to a Linux software repository. The instructions in this article describe configuring your device to use one of these repositories. 

The choice of the channel determines the type and frequency of updates that are offered to your device. Devices in insiders-fast are the first ones to receive updates and new features, followed later by insiders-slow and lastly by prod. 

In order to preview new features and provide early feedback, it's recommended that you configure some devices in your enterprise to use either `insiders-fast` or `insiders-slow`. 

> [!WARNING]
> Switching the channel after the initial installation requires the product to be reinstalled. To switch the product channel: uninstall the existing package, reconfigure your device to use the new channel, and follow the steps in this document to install the package from the new location.
