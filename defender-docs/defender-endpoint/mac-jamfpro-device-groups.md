# Set up Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS device groups in Jamf Pro

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.  

Set up the device groups similar to Group policy  organizational unite (OUs), Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager's device collection, and Intune's device groups.

1. Navigate to **Static Computer Groups**.

2. Select **New**.

> [!NOTE]
> You aren't required to use static groups. It's often more convenient and flexible to use, for example, [JAMF Pro's smart groups](https://docs.jamf.com/10.40.0/jamf-pro/documentation/Smart_Groups.html) instead.
