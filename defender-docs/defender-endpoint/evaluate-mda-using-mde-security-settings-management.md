# Evaluate Microsoft Defender Antivirus using Microsoft Defender Endpoint Security Settings Management (Endpoint security policies)

In Windows 10 or later, and in Windows Server 2016 or later, you can use next-generation protection features offered by Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MDAV) and Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard (Microsoft Defender EG).

This article outlines the configuration options available in Windows 10 and later versions, as well as in Windows Server 2016 and later versions. It provides step-by-step guidance on how to activate and test the key protection features in Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MDAV) and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EG).

If you have any questions about a detection that MDAV makes, or you discover a missed detection, you can submit a file to us at our [sample submission help site](/unified-secops-platform/submission-guide).

## Use Microsoft Defender Endpoint Security Settings Management (Endpoint security policies) to enable the features

This section describes the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Security Settings Management (Endpoint security policies)](/mem/intune/protect/mde-security-integration) that configure the features you should use to evaluate our protection.

MDAV indicates a detection through [standard Windows notifications](configure-notifications-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md). You can also review detections in the MDAV app. To do this, see [Review Microsoft Defender Antivirus scan results](review-scan-results-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

The Windows event log also records detection and engine events. See the Microsoft Defender Antivirus events article for a list of event IDs and their corresponding actions. For information on the list of event IDs and their corresponding actions, see [Review event logs and error codes to troubleshoot issues with Microsoft Defender Antivirus](troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus.yml).

To configure the options that you must use to test the protection features, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://sip.security.microsoft.com/).
1. Go to **Endpoints > Configuration management > Endpoint security policies > Windows policies > Create new policy**.
1. Select **Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server** from the **Select Platform** drop-down list.
1. Select **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** from the **Select Template** drop-down list.
1. Select **Create policy**. The **Create a new policy** page appears.
1. On the **Basics** page, enter a name and description for the profile in the **Name** and **Description** fields, respectively.

1. On the **Configuration settings** page, expand the groups of settings.
1. From these groups of settings, select those settings that you want to manage with this profile.
1. Set the policies for the chosen groups of settings by configuring the settings as described in the following tables:
