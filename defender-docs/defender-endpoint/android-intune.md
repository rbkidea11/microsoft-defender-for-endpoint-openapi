### Auto setup of always-on VPN

Defender for Endpoint supports device configuration policies for managed devices with Microsoft Intune. This capability enables you to use auto setup of always-on VPN on Android Enterprise enrolled devices, so the end user doesn't need to set up a VPN service while onboarding.

1. On **Devices**, select **Configuration Profiles** \> **Create Profile** \> **Platform** \> **Android Enterprise**. Select **Device restrictions** under one of the following, based on your device enrollment type:

   - **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile**
   - **Personally owned Work Profile**

   Then, select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/1autosetupofvpn.png" alt-text="The Configuration profiles menu item in the Policy pane" lightbox="media/1autosetupofvpn.png":::

2. **Configuration Settings**. Provide a **Name** and a **Description** to uniquely identify the configuration profile.

   :::image type="content" source="media/2autosetupofvpn.png" alt-text="The devices configuration profile Name and Description fields in the Basics pane" lightbox="media/2autosetupofvpn.png":::

3. Select **Connectivity**, and then configure your VPN.

   1. Enable **Always-on VPN**. Set up a VPN client in the work profile to automatically connect and reconnect to the VPN whenever possible. Only one VPN client can be configured for always-on VPN on a given device, so be sure to have no more than one always-on VPN policy deployed to a single device.

   2. In the **VPN client** list, select **Custom**. In this case, the custom VPN is the Defender for Endpoint VPN, which provides Web Protection.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app must be installed on user's device for automatic VPN setup to occur.

   3. Specify the **Package ID** of the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint app in Google Play store. For the [Microsoft Defender app URL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.scmx), the package ID is `com.microsoft.scmx`.

   4. Set **Lockdown mode** to **Not configured (Default)**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/3autosetupofvpn.png" alt-text="The Connectivity pane under the Configuration settings tab" lightbox="media/3autosetupofvpn.png":::

4. **Assignment**. On the **Assignments** page, select the user group to which this app config policy would be assigned. Choose **Select groups** to include, select the applicable group, and then select **Next**. 

   The group to select is typically the same group to which you would assign Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Android app.

   :::image type="content" source="media/4autosetupofvpn.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the devices configuration profile Assignment pane in the Device restrictions." lightbox="media/4autosetupofvpn.png":::

5. In the **Review + Create** page that comes up next, review all the information and then select **Create**.
The device configuration profile is now assigned to the selected user group.

## Check status and complete onboarding

1. Confirm the installation status of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android by tapping **Device Install Status**. Verify that the device is displayed here.

   :::image type="content" source="media/900c0197aa59f9b7abd762ab2b32e80c.png" alt-text="The device installation status pane" lightbox="media/900c0197aa59f9b7abd762ab2b32e80c.png":::

2. On the device, you can validate the onboarding status by going to the work profile. Confirm that Defender for Endpoint is available, and that you're enrolled using the **Personally owned devices with work profile**. If you're enrolled using a **Corporate-owned, fully managed user device**, you have a single profile on the device where you can confirm that Defender for Endpoint is available.

3. When the app is installed, open the app, and then accept the permissions. Onboarding should successfully complete.

## Configure low-touch onboarding

> [!NOTE]
> Android low touch onboarding is now GA.

Administrators can configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in low-touch onboarding mode. In this scenario, administrators creates a deployment profile, and the user is required to provide a reduced set of permissions to complete onboarding. Android low-touch onboarding is disabled by default. Administrators can enable it through app configuration policies on Intune by following these steps:

1. Push the Microsoft Defender app to target user groups by following the steps in the section, [Add Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Android as a Managed Google Play app](#add-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-on-android-as-a-managed-google-play-app) (in this article).

2. Push a VPN profile to the user's device by following the instructions in the section, [Auto Setup of Always-on VPN](#auto-setup-of-always-on-vpn) (in this article).

3. In **Apps** > **Application configuration policies**, select **Managed Devices**.

4. Provide a name to uniquely identify the policy. 

   - For **Platform**, select `Android Enterprise`.
   - Select the required profile type.
   - For the targeted app, select `Microsoft Defender: Antivirus`.
   
   Then select **Next**.

5. Add runtime permissions. Select **Location access (fine)**, **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** and change the **Permission state** to `Auto grant`. (This permission isn't supported for Android 13 and later.)

6. Under **Configuration settings**, select `Use Configuration designer`, and then select **Add**.

7. Select **Low touch onboarding and User UPN**. For User UPN, change the value type to `Variable`, and set the configuration value to `User Principal Name`. Enable low-touch onboarding by changing its configuration value to `1`.

   After the policy is created, these value types show up as string values.
 
8. Assign the policy to the target user group.

9. Review and create the policy.

## Set up Microsoft Defender in personal profile on Android Enterprise in BYOD mode

### Set up Microsoft Defender in personal profile

Administrators can use the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://intune.microsoft.com) to set up and configure Microsoft Defender support in personal profiles by following these steps:

1. Go to **Apps** > **App configuration policies**, and then select **Add**. Select **Managed Devices**.

   - Specify a name and description to uniquely identify the configuration policy. 
   - For **Platform**, select platform as **Android Enterprise**
   - For **Profile type**, select **Personally-owned work profile only**
   - For **Targeted app**, select **Microsoft Defender**.

2. On the settings page, in **Configuration settings format**, select **Use configuration designer**, and then select **Add**. From the list of configurations that are displayed, select **Microsoft Defender in Personal profile**.

3. The selected configuration is listed. Change the configuration value to `1` to enable Microsoft Defender support personal profiles. A notification appears to inform the administrator. Select **Next**.

4. Assign the configuration policy to a group of users. Review and create the policy.

Administrators also can set up privacy controls in the Microsoft Intune admin center to control what data is sent by the Microsoft Defender app to the Microsoft Defender portal. For more information, see [configure privacy controls](android-configure.md).

Organizations can communicate to their users to protect their personal profile by using the Microsoft Defender app on their enrolled BYOD devices. The Microsoft Defender app must be installed and active, using their work profile for Microsoft Defender to be enabled in personal profiles.

### Finish onboarding a device

1. Install the Microsoft Defender application in a personal profile with a personal Google Play store account.

2. Install the Company portal application on personal profile. No sign-in is required.

3. When a user launches the application, they see the sign-in screen. **Login using corporate account only**.

4. After signing in successfully, users see the following screens:

   - **EULA screen**: Presented only if the user hasn't consented already in their work profile.
   - **Notice screen**: Users must provide consent on this screen to move forward with onboarding the application. This is required only during the first run of the app.

5. Provide the required permissions to complete onboarding.

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Pre-requisites**:
   > 1. The Company portal needs to be enabled on personal profile.
   > 2. Microsoft Defender needs to be already installed and active in work profile.
