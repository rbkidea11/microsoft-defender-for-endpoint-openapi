> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting February 16, 2025, new Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers will only have access to the Unified Role-Based Access Control (URBAC).
> Existing customers keep their current roles and permissions. For more information, see URBAC [Unified Role-Based Access Control (URBAC) for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-xdr/manage-rbac)

## Create roles and assign the role to a Microsoft Entra group

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

The following steps guide you on how to create roles in the Microsoft Defender portal. It assumes that you have already created Microsoft Entra user groups.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) using account with the Security Administrator role assigned.

2. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** \> **Endpoints** \> **Roles** (under **Permissions**).

3. Select **Add role**.

4. Enter the role name, description, and permissions you'd like to assign to the role.

5. Select **Next** to assign the role to a Microsoft Entra Security group.

6. Use the filter to select the Microsoft Entra group that you'd like to add to this role to.

7. **Save and close**.

8. Apply the configuration settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After creating roles, you'll need to create a device group and provide access to the device group by assigning it to a role that you created.

> [!NOTE]
> Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.
