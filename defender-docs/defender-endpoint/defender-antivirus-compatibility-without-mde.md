# Microsoft Defender Antivirus and non-Microsoft antivirus solutions without Defender for Endpoint

**Applies to**:

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](defender-endpoint-plan-1.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Individuals](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-defender-for-individuals?msockid=0f1c3b9963366db31ba02e78621b6c1e#Overview)
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus

This section describes what happens when you use Microsoft Defender Antivirus alongside non-Microsoft antivirus/antimalware products on endpoints that aren't onboarded to Defender for Endpoint Plan 2.

Microsoft Defender Antivirus doesn't run in passive mode on devices that aren't onboarded to Defender for Endpoint Plan 2.

The following table summarizes what to expect:

| Windows version |Primary antivirus/antimalware solution|Microsoft Defender Antivirus state|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Windows 11 and Windows 10   |Microsoft Defender Antivirus|Active mode|
|Windows 11 and Windows 10|A non-Microsoft antivirus solution|Disabled mode (happens automatically).|
|Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server, version 1803 or newer, Windows Server 2016|Microsoft Defender Antivirus|Active mode|
|Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server, version 1803 or newer, Windows Server 2016|A non-Microsoft antivirus solution|Disabled (set manually; see the note that follows this table)|

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint support for Windows Server 2025 is rolling out, beginning in February 2025 and over the next several weeks.
> On Windows Server, if you're running a non-Microsoft antivirus product, you can uninstall Microsoft Defender Antivirus by using the following PowerShell cmdlet (as an administrator): `Uninstall-WindowsFeature Windows-Defender`. Restart your server to finish removing Microsoft Defender Antivirus. On Windows Server 2016, you might see *Windows Defender Antivirus* instead of *Microsoft Defender Antivirus*. If you uninstall your non-Microsoft antivirus product, make sure that Microsoft Defender Antivirus is re-enabled. See **[Re-enable Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows Server if it was disabled](/defender-endpoint/enable-update-mdav-to-latest-ws)**.

Check the services and filter drivers for Microsoft Defender Antivirus by using the following command:

```powershell

gsv WinDefend, WdBoot, WdFilter, WdNisSvc, WdNisDrv | ft -auto DisplayName, Name, StartType, Status

```

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** Can I update Microsoft Defender Antivirus components such as "Security intelligence update" or "Engine update" or "Platform update" when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is disabled?

**A:** No. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is disabled, since the services and drivers aren't running, you won't be able to update the components such as "Security intelligence update" or "Engine update" or "Platform update".

> [!TIP]

**Q:** Can I manually change the start type of the services and drivers for Microsoft Defender Antivirus?

```

Windows Server 2016
```powershell

Uninstall-WindowsFeature Windows-Defender
Uninstall-WindowsFeature Windows-Defender-Gui
