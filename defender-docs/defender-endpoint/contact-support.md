# Contact Microsoft Defender for Endpoint support

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr)

Defender for Endpoint has recently upgraded the support process to offer a more modern and advanced support experience.

The new widget allows customers to:

- Find solutions to common problems
- Submit a support case to the Microsoft support team

## Prerequisites

It's important to know the specific roles that have permission to open support cases.

At a minimum, you must have a Service Support Administrator **OR** Helpdesk Administrator role.

For more information on which roles have permission, see [Security Administrator permissions](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-administrator). 

For general information on admin roles, see [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

You must have a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 or Plan 2 license to open support cases. If you're using only Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 or Plan 2, you must purchase at least one Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 or Plan 2 as well to open a support case.

## Access the widget

Accessing the new support widget can be done in one of two ways:

1. Clicking on the question mark on the top right of the portal and then clicking on "Microsoft support":

   :::image type="content" source="/defender/media/contactsupport.png" alt-text="The Microsoft support icon in the Microsoft Defender portal" lightbox="/defender/media/contactsupport.png":::

2. Clicking on the **Need help?**  button in the bottom right of the Microsoft Defender portal:

   :::image type="content" source="media/need-help-option.png" alt-text="The Need help button" lightbox="media/need-help-option.png":::

In the widget you'll be offered two options:

- Find solutions to common problems
- Open a service request

## Find solutions to common problems

This option includes articles that might be related to the question you may ask. Just start typing the question in the search box and articles related to your search will be surfaced.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/contactsupport1.png" alt-text="How can we help?" lightbox="/defender/media/contactsupport1.png":::

In case the suggested articles aren't sufficient, you can open a service request.

## Open a service request
