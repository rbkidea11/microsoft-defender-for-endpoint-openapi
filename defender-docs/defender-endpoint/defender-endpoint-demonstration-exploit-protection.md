Exploit Protection automatically applies exploit mitigation settings system wide and on individual apps. Many of the features in the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) have been included in Exploit Protection, and you can convert and import existing EMET configuration profiles into Exploit Protection.

## Scenario requirements and setup

- Windows client devices must be running Windows 11 or Windows 10 1709 build 16273 or newer
- Windows server devices must be running Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2016.
- Run PowerShell commands:

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath ProcessMitigation.xml
```

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation â€“help
```

- Verify configuration

```powershell

Get-ProcessMitigation
```

### Sample xml file

[EP xml config file](https://demo.wd.microsoft.com/Content/ProcessMitigation.xml?) (right select, "save target as")

## Scenario

### Scenario 1: Convert EMET xml to Exploit Protection settings

1. Convert EMET to xml, run PowerShell command:

```powershell
ConvertTo-ProcessMitigationPolicy
```

2. Apply settings, run PowerShell command:  *use the XML from the prior step*

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath
```

3. Confirm settings were applied, run PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-ProcessMitigation
```

4. Review the event log for application compatibility

### Scenario 2: Apply selfhost xml to Exploit Protection settings

1. Download our EP xml config file (right select, "save target as") or use your own
2. Apply settings, run PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-ProcessMitigation -PolicyFilePath ProcessMitigation.xml
```

3. Confirm settings were applied, run PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-ProcessMitigation
