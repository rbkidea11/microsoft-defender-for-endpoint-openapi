# User Experiences in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on iOS

As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering an exceptional user experience, we are excited to announce a series of upcoming changes to the user interface and overall experience of our MDE mobile app. These enhancements are designed to improve usability, streamline navigation, and ensure our app meets the evolving needs of our users. This document outlines the planned updates for MDE Mobile users.

## Key changes

We are pleased to introduce the **Device Protection** feature card for our enterprise users which includes Web Protection, Device Health and Jail break feature that has been designed to be more user-friendly and accessible. The updated feature cards now include recommendation cards. The first recommendation card will prominently display any active alerts, ensuring you stay informed. Additionally, a list of features will now be presented in the form of tiles as a part of L2 screens enhancing ease of use and navigation.

**The main changes involved are**:

- Main dashboard changes
- List the features inside one feature card
- Detailed features experience
- Recommendation cards for alerts
- Onboarding screens

### Main Dashboard changes

### List the features inside one feature card

One feature card called **Device Protection** lists Web Protection, Device Health, and Jail Break. Previously, the dashboard had one card for each set of capabilities. In the new experience, only the Device Protection card changes.

### Recommendation Cards for Alerts

The structure of the dashboard is updated to include a recommendation card that contains active alerts (if any). In case there are multiple alerts, resolving the top alert brings forward the next one. Recommendation cards are implemented to provide a more cohesive user experience. These cards are designed to display important alerts and notifications prominently on the dashboard. Here are a few examples:

1. **Web Protection**

2. **Device Health (iOS Update)**
