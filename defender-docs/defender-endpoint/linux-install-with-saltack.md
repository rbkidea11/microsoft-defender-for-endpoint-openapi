You can deploy [Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md) by using various tools and methods. This article describes how to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux using Saltstack. A successful deployment requires the completion of all of the steps in this article. (To use another method, refer to the [See also](#see-also) section.)

[!INCLUDE [side-by-side-scenarios](includes/side-by-side-scenarios.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint third-party tool support](../includes/support.md)]

## Prerequisites and system requirements

Before you get started, see [Prerequisites for Defender for Endpoint on Linux](mde-linux-prerequisites.md) for a description of prerequisites and system requirements.

In addition, for Saltstack deployment, you need to be familiar with Saltstack administration, have Saltstack installed, configure the Master and Minions, and know how to apply states. Saltstack has many ways to complete the same task. These instructions assume availability of supported Saltstack modules, such as *apt* and *unarchive* to help deploy the package. Your organization might use a different workflow. For more information, see [Saltstack documentation](https://docs.saltproject.io/).

Here are a few important points:

- Saltstack is installed on at least one computer (Saltstack calls the computer as the master).
- The Saltstack master accepted the managed nodes (Saltstack calls the nodes as minions) connections.
- The Saltstack minions are able to resolve communication to the Saltstack master (by default the minions try to communicate with a machine named *salt*).
- Run the following ping test: `sudo salt '*' test.ping`
- The Saltstack master has a file server location where the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint files can be distributed from (by default Saltstack uses the `/srv/salt` folder as the default distribution point)

## Download the onboarding package

[!INCLUDE [Defender for Endpoint repackaging warning](../includes/repackaging-warning.md)]

1. In Microsoft Defender portal, go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.

2. In the first drop-down menu, select **Linux Server** as the operating system. In the second drop-down menu, select **Your preferred Linux configuration management tool** as the deployment method.

3. Select **Download onboarding package**. Save the file as `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`.

   :::image type="content" source="media/portal-onboarding-linux-2.png" alt-text="The Download onboarding package option":::

4. On the SaltStack Master, extract the contents of the archive to the SaltStack Server's folder (typically `/srv/salt`):

   ```bash
   unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip -d /srv/salt/mde
   ```

   ```console
   Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
   inflating: /srv/salt/mde/mdatp_onboard.json
   ```

## Create Saltstack state files

There are two ways you can create the Saltstack state files:

- **Use the installer Script (recommended):** With this method, the script automates deployment by installing the agent, onboarding the device to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), and configuring the repositories to pick the correct agent compatible with your Linux distribution.

- **Manually configure the repositories:** With this method, repositories must be configured manually along with selecting agent version compatible with your Linux distribution. This method gives you more granular control over the deployment process.

### Create Saltstack state files using the installer script

1. Pull the [installer bash script](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh) from Microsoft GitHub Repository, or use the following command to download it:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/refs/heads/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh /srv/salt/mde/
   ```


2. Create the state file `/srv/salt/install_mdatp.sls` with the following content. The same can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/third_party_installation_playbooks/salt.install_mdatp_simplified.sls)

   ```bash
   #Download the mde_installer.sh: https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh
    install_mdatp_package:
      cmd.run:
        - name: /srv/salt/mde/mde_installer.sh --install --onboard /srv/salt/mde/mdatp_onboard.json
        - shell: /bin/bash
        - unless: 'pgrep -f mde_installer.sh'
   ```
  
> [!NOTE]
> The installer script also supports other parameters such as channel (insiders-fast, insiders-slow, prod (default)), real-time protection, version, etc. To select from the list of available options, check help through the following command:
>```./mde_installer.sh --help```

### Create Saltstack state files by manually configuring repositories

In this step, you create a SaltState state file in your configuration repository (typically `/srv/salt`) that applies the necessary states to deploy and onboard Defender for Endpoint. Then, you add the Defender for Endpoint repository and key: `install_mdatp.sls`.

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint on Linux can be deployed from one of the following channels:
> - *insiders-fast*, denoted as `[channel]`
> - *insiders-slow*, denoted as `[channel]`
> - *prod*, denoted as `[channel]` using the version name (see [Linux Software Repository for Microsoft Products](/linux/packages))
> 
> Each channel corresponds to a Linux software repository. The choice of the channel determines the type and frequency of updates that are offered to your device. Devices in *insiders-fast* are the first ones to receive updates and new features, followed later by *insiders-slow*, and lastly by *prod*.
> 
> In order to preview new features and provide early feedback, it's recommended that you configure some devices in your enterprise to use either *insiders-fast* or *insiders-slow*.

> [!WARNING]
> Switching the channel after the initial installation requires the product to be reinstalled. To switch the product channel: uninstall the existing package, reconfigure your device to use the new channel, and follow the steps in this document to install the package from the new location.

1. Note your distribution and version and identify the closest entry for it under `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/[distro]/`.

2. In the following commands, replace `[distro]` and `[version]` with your information.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For Oracle Linux and Amazon Linux 2, replace `[distro]` with "rhel." For Amazon Linux 2, replace `[version]` with "7". For Oracle utilize, replace `[version]` with the version of Oracle Linux.

   ```bash
   cat /srv/salt/install_mdatp.sls
   ```

   ```console
   add_ms_repo:
     pkgrepo.managed:
       - humanname: Microsoft Defender Repository
       {% if grains['os_family'] == 'Debian' %}
       - name: deb [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64] https://packages.microsoft.com/[distro]/[version]/[channel] [codename] main
       - dist: [codename]
       - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-[channel].list
       - key_url: https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
       - refresh: true
       {% elif grains['os_family'] == 'RedHat' %}
       - name: packages-microsoft-[channel]
       - file: microsoft-[channel]
       - baseurl: https://packages.microsoft.com/[distro]/[version]/[channel]/
       - gpgkey: https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
       - gpgcheck: true
       {% endif %}
   ```

3. Add the package installed state to `install_mdatp.sls` after the `add_ms_repo` state as previously defined.

   ```console
   install_mdatp_package:
     pkg.installed:
       - name: matp
       - required: add_ms_repo
   ```

4. Add the onboarding file deployment to `install_mdatp.sls` after the `install_mdatp_package` as previously defined.

   ```console
   copy_mde_onboarding_file:
     file.managed:
       - name: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json
       - source: salt://mde/mdatp_onboard.json
       - required: install_mdatp_package
   ```

   The completed install state file should look similar to this output:

   ```console
   add_ms_repo:
   pkgrepo.managed:
   - humanname: Microsoft Defender Repository
   {% if grains['os_family'] == 'Debian' %}
   - name: deb [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64] https://packages.microsoft.com/[distro]/[version]/prod [codename] main
   - dist: [codename]
   - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-[channel].list
   - key_url: https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   - refresh: true
   {% elif grains['os_family'] == 'RedHat' %}
   - name: packages-microsoft-[channel]
   - file: microsoft-[channel]
   - baseurl: https://packages.microsoft.com/[distro]/[version]/[channel]/
   - gpgkey: https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   - gpgcheck: true
   {% endif %}

   install_mdatp_package:
   pkg.installed:
   - name: mdatp
   - required: add_ms_repo

   copy_mde_onboarding_file:
   file.managed:
   - name: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json
   - source: salt://mde/mdatp_onboard.json
   - required: install_mdatp_package
   ```

5. Create a SaltState state file in your configuration repository (typically `/srv/salt`) that applies the necessary states to offboard and remove Defender for Endpoint. Before using the offboarding state file, you need to download the offboarding package from the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) and extract it in the same way you did the onboarding package. The downloaded offboarding package is only valid for a limited period of time.

6. Create an Uninstall state file `uninstall_mdapt.sls` and add the state to remove the `mdatp_onboard.json` file.

   ```bash
   cat /srv/salt/uninstall_mdatp.sls
   ```

   ```console
   remove_mde_onboarding_file:
     file.absent:
       - name: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json
   ```

7. Add the offboarding file deployment to the `uninstall_mdatp.sls` file after the `remove_mde_onboarding_file` state defined in the previous section.

   ```console
    offboard_mde:
     file.managed:
       - name: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_offboard.json
       - source: salt://mde/mdatp_offboard.json
   ```

8. Add the removal of the MDATP package to the `uninstall_mdatp.sls` file after the `offboard_mde` state defined in the previous section.

   ```console
   remove_mde_packages:
     pkg.removed:
       - name: mdatp
   ```

   The complete uninstall state file should look similar to the following output:

   ```console
   remove_mde_onboarding_file:
     file.absent:
       - name: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json

   offboard_mde:
     file.managed:
       - name: /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/mdatp_offboard.json
       - source: salt://mde/offboard/mdatp_offboard.json

   remove_mde_packages:
      pkg.removed:
        - name: mdatp
   ```

## Deploy Defender on Endpoint using the state files created earlier

This step applies to both the installer script or manual configuration method. In this step, you apply the state to the minions. The following command applies the state to machines with the name that begins with `mdetest`.

1. Installation:

   ```bash
   salt 'mdetest*' state.apply install_mdatp
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > When the product starts for the first time, it downloads the latest anti-malware definitions. Depending on your Internet connection, this process can take a few minutes.

2. Validation/configuration:

   ```bash
   salt 'mdetest*' cmd.run 'mdatp connectivity test'
   ```

   ```bash
   salt 'mdetest*' cmd.run 'mdatp health'
   ```

3. Uninstallation:

   ```bash
   salt 'mdetest*' state.apply uninstall_mdatp
   ```

## Troubleshoot installation issues
