# Details and results of automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2](mdo-about.md#defender-for-office-365-plan-2-capabilities), details about active and completed investigations from [automated investigation and response (AIR) in Defender for Office 365](air-about.md) are available on the **Investigations** page in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/airinvestigation>. Investigation details provide you with up-to-date status and (with the right permissions) the ability to approve any pending actions.

> [!TIP]
> AIR details and results are also available in Microsoft Defender XDR on the **Investigations** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/incidents>. For more information, see [Unified investigation page](/defender-xdr/m365d-autoir-results#new-unified-investigation-page).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To see the permissions and licensing requirement for AIR, see [Required permissions and licensing for AIR](air-about.md#required-permissions-and-licensing-for-air).

- Email counts are calculated at the time of the investigation. Some counts are recalculated when you open investigation flyouts (based on the underlying query).

  The following email count values are calculated at the time of investigation and don't change:

  - Email clusters on the **Email** tab.
  - The email quantity value shown on the email clusters flyout.

  The following email count values reflect email messages that were received after the initial analysis of the investigation:
  
  - The email count shown at the bottom of the **Email** tab of the email clusters flyout.
  - The email count shown in Explorer (Threat Explorer)

    For example, an email cluster that shows an original quantity of 10 messages shows an email list total of 15 if five more messages arrive between the investigation analysis phase and when an admin reviews the investigation. Likewise, old investigations might show higher message counts than Threat Explorer queries, because data in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 expires seven days after the end of a trial and 30 days later for paid licenses.

    Historical and current email message counts are shown in different views to give the following information:

    - The email effect at the time of investigation.
    - The current email effect up to when the remediation is run.

- For email, you might see a volume anomaly threat as part of the investigation. A _volume anomaly_ indicates a spike in similar email messages around the investigation event time compared to earlier times. A spike in email traffic together with similarity in certain message properties (for example, subject, message body, sender domain, and sender IP) typically indicates the beginning of email attacks. But bulk email, spam, and legitimate email campaigns commonly share these same message properties.

## Investigations from AIR in Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

In the Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Investigations**. Or, to go directly to the **Investigations** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/airinvestigation>.

By default, investigation details from yesterday and today are shown, but you can change the date range.

The following information shown on the **Investigations** page. You can sort the entries by clicking on an available column header. Select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns** to change the columns that are shown. By default, all available columns are selected:

- **ID**: The unique ID of the investigation. Select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-copy-icon.png" border="false"::: **Open in new window** to open the details of the investigation as described in the [View investigation details](#view-investigation-details-from-air-in-defender-for-office-365-plan-2) section.
- **Status**: The available status values are described in the [Investigation Status values](#investigation-status-values) section.
- **Detection Source**: This value is always **Office365**.
- **Investigation**
- **Users**
- **Creation Time**
- **Last Changed Time**
- **Threat count**
- **Action count**
- **Duration of investigation**

To filter the entries, select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter**. The following filters are available in the **Filter** flyout that opens:

- **Investigation type** section: Select one or more of the following values:
  - **Manual investigation**
  - **User-reported messages**
  - **Zapped File**
  - **Zapped URL**
  - **URL verdict change**
  - **User compromised**
- **Time range** section: Select **Start date** and **End date** values. Data is available for the last 72 days.
- **Status** section: Select one or more of the following values described in the [Investigation Status values](#investigation-status-values) section:
  - **Starting**
  - **Running**
  - **No Threats Found**
  - **Terminated by System**
  - **Pending Action**
  - **Threats Found**
  - **Remediated**
  - **Partially Remediated**
  - **Terminated by User**
  - **Failed**
  - **Queued by Throttling**
  - **Terminated by Throttling**

When you're finished in the **Filter** flyout, select **Apply**. To clear the filters, select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-clear-filters-icon.png" border="false"::: **Clear filters**.

Use the :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box to find information on the page. Type text in the box and then press the ENTER key.

Use :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-download-icon.png" border="false"::: **Export** to save the visible information to a CSV file. The default filename is Investigations - Microsoft Defender.csv, and the default location is the local Downloads folder. If an exported report already exists in that location, the filename is incremented (for example, Investigations - Microsoft Defender (1).csv).

### Investigation Status values

The **Status** values of an investigation indicate the progress of the analysis and actions. As the investigation runs, the **Status** value is updated to indicate whether threats were found, and whether actions have been approved.

The **Status** values that are used in investigations are described in the following list:

- **Failed**: At least one investigation analyzer ran into a problem where it couldn't complete properly.

  If an investigation fails after remediation actions were approved, the remediation actions might still have succeeded. For more information, [view the investigation details](#view-investigation-details-from-air-in-defender-for-office-365-plan-2).

- **No Threats Found**: The investigation finished and no threats were identified (compromised user accounts, email messages, URLs, or files).

  If you suspect something malicious was missed (a false negative), you can take action using [Threat Explorer (Explorer)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md).

- **Partially Investigated** (formerly known as **Threats found**): The automated investigation found issues, but without specific remediation actions to resolve the issues. Occurs when some type of user activity was identified, but no cleanup actions are available. Examples include any of the following user activities:
  - A [data loss prevention (DLP)](/purview/dlp-learn-about-dlp) event.
  - An email sending anomaly.
  - Sent malware.
  - Sent phishing.
  - The investigation found nothing to do. For example:
    - No malicious URLs, files, or email messages to remediate.
    - No mailbox activity to fix (for example, turn off forwarding rules or delegation).

  If you suspect something malicious was missed (a false negative), you can take action using [Threat Explorer (Explorer)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md).

- **Partially Remediated**: The investigation resulted in remediation actions, and some were approved and completed. Other actions are still [pending approval](air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md).

- **Pending Action**: The investigation found a threat (for example, a malicious email, a malicious URL, or a risky mailbox setting), and an action to remediate the threat is [awaiting approval](air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md).

  The list of pending actions can increase as an investigation runs. [View the investigation details](#view-investigation-details-from-air-in-defender-for-office-365-plan-2) to see if other items are still pending completion.

- **Queued By Throttling**: An investigation is being held in a queue. When other investigations complete, queued investigations begin. Throttling helps avoid poor service performance.

  Pending actions can limit how many new investigations can run. Make sure to [approve or reject pending actions](air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md#approve-or-reject-pending-actions-from-the-investigations-page-in-defender-for-office-365).

- **Remediated**: The investigation finished and all remediation actions were approved (noted as fully remediated).

  Approved remediation actions can have errors that prevent the actions from being taken. Regardless of whether remediation actions are successfully completed, the investigation status doesn't change. For more information, [view the investigation details](#view-investigation-details-from-air-in-defender-for-office-365-plan-2).

- **Running**: The investigation process is underway. This status value also occurs when [pending actions](air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions.md#approve-or-reject-pending-actions-from-the-investigations-page-in-defender-for-office-365) are approved.

- **Starting**: The investigation has been triggered and is waiting to start running.

- **Terminated By System**: The investigation stopped. For example:
  - Pending actions have expired (available for a maximum of one week).
  - Too many actions. For example, too many users clicking on malicious URLs can exceed the investigation's ability to run all the analyzers, so the investigation halts.

  If an investigation halts before actions were taken, try using [Threat Explorer (Explorer)](threat-explorer-real-time-detections-about.md) to find and address threats.

- **Terminated By Throttling**: An investigation automatically stops after it's been queued for too long, it stops.

  You can [start an investigation from Threat Explorer (Explorer)](air-examples.md#example-a-security-administrator-triggers-an-investigation-from-threat-explorer).
