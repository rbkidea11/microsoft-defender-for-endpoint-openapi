# Manage OAuth apps

Many third-party productivity apps that might be installed by business users in your organization request permission to access user information and data and sign in on behalf of the user in other cloud apps, such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace and Salesforce. When users install these apps, they often click accept without closely reviewing the details in the prompt, including granting permissions to the app. This problem is compounded by the fact that IT may not have enough insight to weigh the security risk of an application against the productivity benefit that it provides. Because accepting third-party app permissions is a potential security risk to your organization, monitoring the app permissions your users' grant gives you the necessary visibility and control to protect your users and your applications.

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps app permissions enable you to see which user-installed OAuth applications have access to Microsoft 365 data, Google Workspace data, and Salesforce data. Defender for Cloud Apps tells you what permissions the apps have and which users granted these apps access to their Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce accounts. App permissions help you decide which apps you allow your users to access and which ones you want to ban.

## Prerequisites

You must have connected one or more of the supported platforms to Defender for Cloud Apps, including Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or Salesforce.

## Working with the OAuth apps page

The **OAuth** page displays information about app permissions in your connected apps.

To access the OAuth tab:

In the Microsoft Defender Portal, under **Cloud Apps** select **OAuth apps**.

The OAuth apps page provides the following information about each OAuth app that was granted permissions. Defender for Cloud Apps only identifies apps that request [*Delegated* permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/developer-glossary#permissions).

## Ban or approve an app

1. On the **Google** or **Salesforce** tabs on the **App governance** page, select the app to open the **App drawer** to view more information about the app and the permissions it was granted.

    - Select **Permissions** to view a full list of permissions that were granted to the app.
    - Under **Community use**, you can view how common the app is in other organizations.
    - Select **App activity** to view the activities that are listed in the activity log related to this app.

2. To ban the app, select the ban icon at the end of the app row in the table.

    ![ban app icon.](media/ban-app-icon.png)

    - You can choose if you want to tell users the app they installed and authorized has been banned. The notification lets users know the app will be disabled and they won't have access to the connected app. If you don't want them to know, unselect **Notify users who granted access to this banned app** in the dialog.
    - It's recommended that you let the app users know their app is about to be banned from use.

    ![ban app.](media/ban-app.png)

3. Type the message you want to send to the app users in the Enter a custom notification message box. Select **Ban app** to send the mail, and ban the app from your connected app users.

4. To approve the app, select the approve icon at the end of the row in the table.

    ![approve app.](media/approve-app.png)

    - The icon turns green, and the app is approved for all your connected app users.
    - When you mark an app as approved, there's no effect on the end user. This color change is meant to help you see the apps that you've approved to separate them from ones that you haven't reviewed yet.

## Query OAuth apps

You can query OAuth apps in either the **Basic** view or the **Advanced** view. select values from one or multiple drop-downs to display the specific apps in the Basic view. In the advanced view, use the **Select a filter** drop-down to narrow your search. Add operators, equals, or doesn't equal, to a selected value to complete your query.

- Choose the **Add a filter** icon to add additional filters to further refine your query. The filters are applied automatically and the apps list is updated.

- Choose the **Remove a filter** icon  next to the filter to remove the filters.

## OAuth app auditing

Defender for Cloud Apps audits all OAuth authorization activities to provide you with comprehensive monitoring and investigation of activities performed. You can also export the details of users that authorized a specific OAuth app, providing you with additional information on the users, which you can then use for further analysis.

To export the log, perform the following steps:

1. On the **Google** or **Salesforce** tabs on the **App governance** page, on the row where the relevant app appears, under **Authorized by**, select the link showing the number of users that authorized the app.

1. In the pop-up, select **Export**.

## Send feedback

If there's an OAuth app discovered in your organization that seems malicious, you can send the Defender for Cloud Apps team feedback to let us know. This feature enables you to be part of our security community and enhance OAuth app risk score and analysis.

1. On the **Google** or **Salesforce** tabs on the **App governance** page, select the three dots at the end of the app row and select **Report app**.

    ![report app.](media/report-app.png)
2. In the **Report this app** screen, you can select whether to report the app as malicious or to report another issue with the way Defender for Cloud Apps perceives the app. For example, you could use **Incorrect publisher**, **Incorrect permissions**, or **Other**. The data you submit will be used to update the app's risk score and other analytics about the app.
