# Troubleshooting data encryption with your own key

This article provides a list of problems that can prevent Defender for Cloud Apps from accessing your Azure Key Vault key used to encrypt collected data at rest.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there's a problem accessing your Azure Key Vault key, Defender for Cloud Apps will fail to encrypt your data, and your tenant will be locked down within an hour. When your tenant is locked down, all access to it will be blocked until the cause has been resolved. Once your key is accessible again, full access to your tenant will be restored
