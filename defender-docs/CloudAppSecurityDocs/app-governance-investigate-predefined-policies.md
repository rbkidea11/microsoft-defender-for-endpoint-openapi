# Investigate predefined app policy alerts

App governance provides predefined app policy alerts for anomalous activities. The purpose of this guide is to provide you with general and practical information on each alert, to help with your investigation and remediation tasks. 

Included in this guide is general information about the conditions for triggering alerts. Because predefined policies are nondeterministic by nature, they're only triggered when there's behavior that deviates from the norm. 

> [!TIP]
> Some alerts might be in preview, so regularly review the updated alert statuses.
>


## Security alert classifications

Following proper investigation, all app governance alerts can be classified into one of the following activity types:

- **True positive (TP)**: An alert on a confirmed malicious activity.
- **Benign true positive (B-TP)**: An alert on suspicious but not malicious activity, such as a penetration test or other authorized suspicious action.
- **False positive (FP)**: An alert on a nonmalicious activity.

## General investigation steps

Use the following general guidelines when investigating any type of alert to gain a clearer understanding of the potential threat before applying the recommended action.

1. Review the app severity level and compare with the rest of the apps in your tenant. This review helps you identify which apps in your tenant pose greater risk.

1. If you identify a TP, review all the app activities to gain an understanding of the impact. For example, review the following app information:
   - Scopes granted access
   - Unusual behavior  
   - IP address and location

## Predefined app policy alerts

This section provides information on each predefined policy alert, along with steps for investigation and remediation.


### Increase in data usage by an overprivileged or highly privileged app

> [!NOTE]
> As part of our continuous efforts to enhance Defender for Cloud apps alert accuracy we have disabled this policy. This policy will remain visible in the Defender portal in a disabled state.
