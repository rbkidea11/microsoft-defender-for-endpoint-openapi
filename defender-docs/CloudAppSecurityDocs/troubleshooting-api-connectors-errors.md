# Troubleshooting App Connector errors

This article provides a list of API App connector error messages and resolution recommendations for each error.

## Troubleshooting

App connector errors can be seen in the app connector dialog after attempting to connect a cloud app using the API App connector.

> [!NOTE]
> If a connector experiences a failure or disconnection, a system alert will be generated. To resume normal operations and maintain connectivity, reconnect the connector on the connectors page.
