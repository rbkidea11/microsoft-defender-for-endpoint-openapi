# Get started with app threat detection and remediation

App governance generates alerts using various mechanisms. Threat detection alerts use built-in, machine-learning-driven detection rules to find malicious app attributes and activities. Policy-based alerts are triggered either by predefined policies or user-defined policies.

To view the latest incidents associated with these alerts, go to the **App governance** >  **Overview** tab in [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://aka.ms/appgovernance).

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/app-governance/mapg-cc-overview-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the App governance > Overview tab with the Latest alerts section highlighted." lightbox="media/app-governance/mapg-cc-overview-alerts.png":::

On the **Overview** tab, the **Latest alerts** section lists the most recent alerts. You can use these recent alerts to quickly see the current app alert activity for your tenant.

To see all of the alerts, select the **Alerts** tab.

## Alerts page

App governance alerts are now listed with all other Microsoft Defender XDR alerts. To find them, filter for "App governance" as the service source.

For example:
