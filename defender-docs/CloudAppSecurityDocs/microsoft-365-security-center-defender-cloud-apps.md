# Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender)
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-cloud-apps/)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is available inside the Microsoft Defender portal. The Defender portal is the home for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure, allowing security admins to perform their security tasks in one location, across multiple Microsoft Defender services.

SOC analysts can triage, investigate, and hunt across all Microsoft Defender XDR workloads, including cloud apps.

Take a look in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>.

Learn more about the benefits: [Overview of Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender).

## Perform cloud app security tasks

Find Defender for Cloud Apps functionality in the Microsoft Defender portal under **Cloud Apps**. For example:

## Investigate cloud app alerts

Defender for Cloud Apps alerts show in the Defender portal's incident and alerts queues, with relevant content inside alert pages for each type of an alert. For more information, see [Investigate incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/investigate-incidents).

## Global search for your connected cloud apps

Use the Microsoft Defender portal's global search bar at the top of the page to search for connected apps in Defender for Cloud Apps.
