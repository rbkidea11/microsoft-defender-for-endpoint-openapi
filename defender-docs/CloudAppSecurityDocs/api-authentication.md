# Managing API tokens



Defender for Cloud Apps exposes much of its data and actions through a set of programmatic APIs. Those APIs will enable you to automate workflows and innovate based on Defender for Cloud Apps capabilities.

To access the Defender for Cloud Apps API, you have to create an API token and use it in your software to connect to the API. This token will be included in the header when Defender for Cloud Apps makes API requests.

The API access requires OAuth2.0 authentication. For more information, see [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code).

In general, youâ€™ll need to take the following steps to use the APIs:

- Create a Microsoft Entra application
- Get an access token using this application
- Use the token to access the Defender for Cloud Apps API

You can access the Defender for Cloud Apps API with **Application Context** or **User Context**.

>[!NOTE]
>[The legacy method](api-tokens-legacy.md) of accessing the Defender for Cloud Apps API is still supported. However, it is on a deprecation path, so we recommend using the methods described on this page.

## Application context (recommended)
  
Used by apps that run without a signed-in user present. For example, apps that run as background services or daemons.

1. Create a Microsoft Entra Web-Application.
1. Assign the desired permission to the application. For example, **Read Alerts** or **Upload Discovery Report**.
1. Create a key for this application.
1. Get the token using the application with its key.
1. Use the token to access the Defender for Cloud Apps API.

For more detailed steps on how to perform these steps, see [Get access with application context](api-authentication-application.md).

## User context

Used to perform actions in the API on behalf of a user.

Steps to take to access the Defender for Cloud Apps API with application context:

1. Create a Microsoft Entra Native-Application.
1. Assign the desired permission to the application. For example, **Read Alerts** or **Upload Discovery Report**.
1. Get the token using the application with user credentials.
1. Use the token to access the Defender for Cloud Apps API.
