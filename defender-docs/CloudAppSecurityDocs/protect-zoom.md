# Connect Zoom to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (Preview)



Zoom is an online video conferencing and collaboration tool. Zoom holds critical data of your organization, and this makes it a target for malicious actors.

## SaaS security posture management

To see security posture recommendations for Zoom in Microsoft Secure Score, create an API connector via the **Connectors** tab, with `“account:read:admin`, `chat_channel:read:admin` and `user:read:admin”` permissions. In Secure Score, select **Recommended actions** and filter by **Product** = **Zoom**.

For example, recommendations for Zoom include: 

- *Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)*
- Enable session timeout for web users
- *Enforce end to end encryption in all Zoom meetings*

If a connector already exists and you don't see Zoom recommendations yet, refresh the connection by disconnecting the API connector, and then reconnecting it with the `“account:read:admin`, `chat_channel:read:admin` and `user:read:admin”` permissions.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting Zoom to Defender for Cloud Apps, make sure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A Zoom PRO plan or higher
- Access to Zoom as an account owner or admin, which is required to access the Zoom API.

    The admin account is used only for initial consent while connecting Zoom to Defender for Cloud Apps. Defender for Cloud Apps uses an OAuth app for daily transactions.

  >[!NOTE]
  > The authentication mechanism utilized in the Zoom connector doesn't support two separate connectors utilizing the same user credentials.<br>
  >
  > When a new instance with an existing authentication token is used, this revokes the old connector token and will cause a "Bad credentials" error.
