# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Asana environment



Asana is a cloud-based project management tool that enables your users to collaborate on projects and tasks across your organization and partners in a streamlined and efficient way. Asana holds critical data of your organization, and this makes it a target for malicious actors. 

Connecting Asana to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your users' activities and provides threat detection using machine learning based anomaly detections.

Main threats include:

- Compromised accounts and insider threats
- Data leakage
- Insufficient security awareness
- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

## Control Asana with policies

| **Type**                           | **Name**                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Built-in  anomaly detection policy** | [Activity from   anonymous IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-anonymous-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Activity from   infrequent country](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-infrequent-country) <br /> [Activity from   suspicious IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-suspicious-ip-addresses)  <br /> [Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)  <br /> [Activity   performed by terminated user](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-performed-by-terminated-user) (requires Microsoft Entra ID as IdP)   <br />[Multiple failed   login attempts](anomaly-detection-policy.md#multiple-failed-login-attempts)  <br /> |
| **Activity  policy**                   | Built a customized policy by using the [Asana Audit Log](https://developers.asana.com/docs/audit-log-events) activities |

For more information about creating policies, see [Create a policy](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md#create-a-policy).

## Automate governance controls

In addition to monitoring for potential threats, you can apply and automate the following Asana governance actions to remediate detected threats:

| **Type**        | **Action**                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User governance** | Notify user on  alert (via Microsoft Entra ID)<br />  Require user to sign in again (via Microsoft Entra ID)   <br /> Suspend user (via Microsoft Entra ID) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).
