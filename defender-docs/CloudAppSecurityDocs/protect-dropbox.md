# How Defender for Cloud Apps helps protect your Dropbox environment



As a cloud file storage and collaboration tool, Dropbox enables your users to share their documents across your organization and partners in a streamlined and efficient way. Using Dropbox may expose your sensitive data not only internally, but also to external collaborators, or even worse make it publicly available via a shared link. Such incidents can be caused by malicious actors, or by unaware employees.

Connecting Dropbox to Defender for Cloud Apps gives you improved insights into your users' activities, provide threat detection using machine learning based anomaly detections, information protection detections such as detecting external information sharing, and enabling automated remediation controls.

> [!NOTE]
> Dropbox have made changes to the way that shared folders are stored. The scan will be updated in due course to include these Teams Spaces.

## Main threats

- Compromised accounts and insider threats
- Data leakage
- Insufficient security awareness
- Malware
- Ransomware
- Unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD)

## Control Dropbox with built-in policies and policy templates

You can use the following built-in policy templates to detect and notify you about potential threats:

| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| Built-in anomaly detection policy | [Activity from anonymous IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-anonymous-ip-addresses)<br />[Activity from infrequent country](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-infrequent-country)<br />[Activity from suspicious IP addresses](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-from-suspicious-ip-addresses)<br />[Impossible travel](anomaly-detection-policy.md#impossible-travel)<br />[Activity performed by terminated user](anomaly-detection-policy.md#activity-performed-by-terminated-user) (requires Microsoft Entra ID as IdP)<br />[Malware detection](anomaly-detection-policy.md#malware-detection)<br />[Multiple failed login attempts](anomaly-detection-policy.md#multiple-failed-login-attempts)<br />[Ransomware detection](anomaly-detection-policy.md#ransomware-activity)<br />[Unusual file deletion activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)<br />[Unusual file share activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user)<br />[Unusual multiple file download activities](anomaly-detection-policy.md#unusual-activities-by-user) |
| Activity policy template | Logon from a risky IP address<br />Mass download by a single user<br />Potential ransomware activity |
| File policy template | Detect a file shared with an unauthorized domain<br />Detect a file shared with personal email addresses<br />Detect files with PII/PCI/PHI |

For more information about creating policies, see [Create a policy](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md#create-a-policy).

## Automate governance controls

In addition to monitoring for potential threats, you can apply and automate the following Dropbox governance actions to remediate detected threats:

| Type | Action |
| ---- | ---- |
| Data governance | - Remove direct shared link<br />- Send DLP violation digest to file owners<br />- Trash file |
| User governance | - Notify user on alert (via Microsoft Entra ID)<br /> - Require user to sign in again (via Microsoft Entra ID)<br /> - Suspend user (via Microsoft Entra ID) |

For more information about remediating threats from apps, see [Governing connected apps](governance-actions.md).

## Protect Dropbox in real time

Review our best practices for [securing and collaborating with external users](best-practices.md#secure-collaboration-with-external-users-by-enforcing-real-time-session-controls) and [blocking and protecting the download of sensitive data to unmanaged or risky devices](best-practices.md#block-and-protect-download-of-sensitive-data-to-unmanaged-or-risky-devices).

## SaaS security posture management
