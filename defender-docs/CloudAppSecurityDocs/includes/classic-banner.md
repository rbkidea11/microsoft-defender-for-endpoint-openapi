> [!NOTE]
>
> Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is now part of [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://security.microsoft.com), which correlates signals from across the Microsoft Defender suite and provides incident-level detection, investigation, and powerful response capabilities. Automatic redirection from the classic portal is on by default for all customers.
>
> Starting June 16, 2024, the redirection toggle to switch back to the classic portal will no longer be available. From then on, all users accessing the classic Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps will be automatically rerouted to the Microsoft Defender portal, with no option to opt out.
>
> To prepare for this change, we recommend that any customers still using the classic portal move operations to the Microsoft Defender portal. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps in the Microsoft Defender portal](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-security-center-defender-cloud-apps).
