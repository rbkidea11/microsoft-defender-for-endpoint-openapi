# Search the audit log for events in Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

The audit log helps you investigate specific activities across Microsoft 365 services. In the Microsoft Defender portal, Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint activities are audited. Some of the activities audited are:

- Changes to data retention settings
- Changes to advanced features
- Creation of indicators of compromise
- Isolation of devices
- Add\edit\deletion of security roles
- Create\edit custom detection rules
- Assign user to an incidents

For a complete list of Microsoft Defender XDR activities that are audited, see [Microsoft Defender XDR activities](#microsoft-defender-xdr-activities) and [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint activities](#microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-activities).

Auditing is automatically turned on for Microsoft Defender XDR. Features that are audited are logged in the audit log automatically. Auditing can also collect audit logs from GCC environments.

## Prerequisites

To access the audit log, you need to have the **View-Only Audit Logs** or **Audit Logs** role in Exchange Online. By default, those roles are assigned to the Compliance Management and Organization Management role groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Global administrators in Office 365 and Microsoft 365 are automatically added as members of the Organization Management role group in Exchange Online.

Microsoft Defender XDR uses the [Microsoft Purview auditing solution](/purview/audit-solutions-overview). Before you can look at the audit data in the Microsoft Defender portal, you need to turn on auditing in the Microsoft Purview portal. For more information, see [Turn auditing on or off](/purview/audit-log-enable-disable).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to scenarios when you can't use an existing role. Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using accounts with lower permissions helps improve security for your organization.

## Search the audit log

Follow these steps to search the audit log:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Defender portal's Audit page](https://security.microsoft.com/auditlogsearch) or go to the [Purview compliance portal](https://purview.microsoft.com) and select **Audit**.

2. On the **New Search** page, filter the activities, dates, and users you want to audit.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Search the audit log in the compliance portal](/purview/audit-new-search).

Audit log record retention is based on Microsoft Purview retention policies. For more information, see [Manage audit log retention policies](/purview/audit-log-retention-policies).
