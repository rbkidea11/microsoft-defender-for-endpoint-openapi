# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

[Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) is part of the Microsoft Defender portal, delivering a unified experience for security teams to manage incidents and alerts, hunt for threats, and automate investigations and responses. The Microsoft Defender portal ([https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com)) combines security capabilities that protect assets, and detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

Endpoints like laptops, phones, tablets, routers, and firewalls are the entry points to your network. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint helps you secure these endpoints by providing visibility into the activities on your network, and by detecting and responding to advanced threats.

This guide shows you what to expect when running Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in the Microsoft Defender portal.

## Know before you begin

To use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in the Microsoft Defender portal, you need to have a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint license. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint licensing](/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements#licensing-requirements).

In addition, confirm that you have the requirements on hardware and software, browser, network connectivity, and compatibility with Microsoft Defender Antivirus. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint minimum requirements](/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements).

You also need to have the required permissions to access the Microsoft Defender portal. For more information, see [Use basic permissions to access the portal](/defender-endpoint/basic-permissions).

## What to expect

### Investigation and response

Investigation and response capabilities in the Microsoft Defender portal help you investigate and respond to incidents and alerts. Incidents are groups of alerts that are related to each other.

#### Incidents and alerts

Devices involved in incidents are shown in an incident's page [attack story](investigate-incidents.md#attack-story), incident graph, and [assets](investigate-incidents.md#assets) tab. You can view the details of the incident, including the devices involved, the alerts that triggered the incident, and the actions taken. You can apply actions to the incident, like isolating devices, collecting investigation packages, and more.

Individual alerts are shown in the Alerts page. You can view the details of the alert, including the devices involved, the incident that the alert is part of, and the actions taken. You can also apply actions to the alert in the alert page.

#### Hunting

Proactively search for threats, malware, and malicious activity across your endpoints, Office 365 mailboxes, and more by using [advanced hunting queries](advanced-hunting-overview.md). These powerful queries can be used to locate and review threat indicators and entities for both known and potential threats.

[Custom detection rules](custom-detection-rules.md) can be built from advanced hunting queries to help you proactively watch for events that might be indicative of breach activity and misconfigured devices.

#### Action center and submissions

The [Action center](m365d-action-center.md) shows you the investigations created by automated investigation and response capabilities. This automated self-healing in the Microsoft Defender portal can help security teams by automatically responding to specific events. You can view actions applied to devices, the status of the actions, and approve or reject the automated actions. Navigate to the Action center page under **Investigation & response > Actions & submissions > Action center**.

You can submit files, email attachments, and URLs to Microsoft Defender for analysis in the [Submission portal](/defender-endpoint/admin-submissions-mde). You can also view the status of the submissions and the results of the analysis. Navigate to the submissions page under **Investigation & response > Actions & submissions > Submissions**.

### Threat intelligence

You can view emerging threats, new attack techniques, prevalent malware, and information about threat actors and campaigns in the **Threat intelligence** page. Access the [threat analytics](/defender-endpoint/threat-analytics) dashboard to view the latest threat intelligence and insights. You can also view read and understand how to protect from certain threats through the [analyst report](/defender-endpoint/threat-analytics-analyst-reports).

Navigate to the threat analytics page under **Threat intelligence > Threat analytics**.

### Device inventory

The **Assets > Devices** page contains the [device inventory](/defender-endpoint/machines-view-overview), which lists all the devices in your organization where alerts were generated. You can view the details of the devices, including the IP address, criticality level, device category, and device type.
