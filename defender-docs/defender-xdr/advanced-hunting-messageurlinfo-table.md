The `MessageUrlInfo` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains information about URLs sent through Microsoft Teams messages in your organization. 

This advanced hunting table is populated by records from Microsoft Defender for Office 365. If your organization hasn’t deployed the service in Microsoft Defender XDR, queries that use the table aren’t going to work or return any results. For more information about how to deploy Defender for Office 365 in Defender XDR, read [Deploy supported services](deploy-supported-services.md).
