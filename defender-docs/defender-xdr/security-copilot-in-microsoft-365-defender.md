## Microsoft Copilot integration in Microsoft Defender

[Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) brings together the power of AI and human expertise to help security teams respond to attacks faster and more effectively. Security Copilot is embedded in the Microsoft Defender portal to help provide security teams with enhanced capabilities to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence. Copilot in Defender is available to users who have provisioned access to Security Copilot.

Security Copilot operates using [Microsoft's AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). To know more, see the [Security Copilot Responsible AI FAQs](/copilot/security/rai-faqs-security-copilot).

## Key features

### Investigate and respond to incidents like an expert

Enable security teams to tackle attack investigations in a timely manner with ease and precision. Copilot helps teams to understand attacks immediately, quickly analyze suspicious files and scripts, and promptly assess and apply appropriate mitigation to stop and contain attacks.

#### Summarize incidents quickly

Investigating incidents with multiple alerts can be a daunting task. To immediately understand an incident, you can tap Copilot to [summarize an incident](security-copilot-m365d-incident-summary.md) for you. Copilot creates an overview of the attack. The overview contains essential information for you to understand what transpired in the attack, what assets are involved, and the timeline of the attack. Copilot automatically creates a summary when you navigate to an incident's page. It also helps you understand the assets involved and how to act by suggesting prompts about related identities, devices, IPs, and so on.

#### Take action on incidents through guided responses

Resolving incidents require analysts to have an understanding of an attack to know what solutions are appropriate. Copilot recommends solutions through [guided responses](security-copilot-m365d-guided-response.md) that are specific to each incident.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/guided-response/copilot-defender-guided-response-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the Copilot pane with the guided responses in the Microsoft Defender incident page." lightbox="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/guided-response/copilot-defender-guided-response.png":::

#### Run script analysis with ease

Most attackers rely on sophisticated malware when launching attacks to avoid detection and analysis. These malware are usually obfuscated, and might be in the form of scripts or command lines in PowerShell. Copilot can quickly [analyze scripts](security-copilot-m365d-script-analysis.md), reducing the time for investigation.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/script-analyzer/copilot-defender-script-analysis-incident-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the script analysis button in the attack story view in the incident page." lightbox="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/script-analyzer/copilot-defender-script-analysis-incident.png":::

#### Generate device summaries

Investigating devices involved in incidents can be a tasking job. To quickly assess a device, Copilot can [summarize a device's information](copilot-in-defender-device-summary.md), including the device's security posture, any unusual behaviors, a list of vulnerable software, and relevant Microsoft Intune information.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/device-summary/copilot-defender-device-summary-device-page-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the device summary results in Copilot in Defender." lightbox="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/device-summary/copilot-defender-device-summary-device-page.png":::

#### Analyze files promptly

Copilot helps security teams quickly assess and understand suspicious files with [file analysis](copilot-in-defender-file-analysis.md). Copilot provides a file's summary, including detection information, related file certificates, a list of API calls, and strings found in the file.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/file-analysis/copilot-defender-file-analysis-hide-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the file analysis results in Copilot in Defender with the Hide details option highlighted." lightbox="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/file-analysis/copilot-defender-file-analysis-hide.png":::

#### Investigate identities immediately

Quickly assess a user's risk by generating an [identity summary](security-copilot-defender-identity-summary.md) with Copilot. Identify when an identity is at risk or suspicious with contextualized information about a user's role and role changes, sign in behaviors, devices signed in to, and relevant contact information.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/identity-summary/identity-incident-graph-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Summarize option in the user details pane." lightbox="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/identity-summary/identity-incident-graph.png":::

#### Write incident reports efficiently

Security operations teams usually write reports to record important information, including what response actions were taken and the corresponding results, the team members involved, and other information to aid future security decisions and learning. Oftentimes, documenting incidents can be time-consuming. For an incident report to be effective, it must contain an incident's summary along with the actions taken, including what actions were taken by whom and when. Copilot [generates an incident report](security-copilot-m365d-create-incident-report.md) by quickly consolidating these pieces of information.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/create-report/incident-report-main1-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the incident report card in the incident page showing the top half of the card." lightbox="/defender/media/copilot-in-defender/create-report/incident-report-main1.png":::

### Hunt like a pro

Copilot in Defender helps security teams proactively hunt for threats in their network by quickly building appropriate KQL queries.

#### Generate KQL queries from natural-language input

Security teams who use advanced hunting to proactively hunt for threats in their network can now use a query assistant that converts any natural-language question, in the context of threat hunting, into a ready-to-run KQL query. The query assistant saves security teams time by generating a KQL query that can then be automatically run or further tweaked according to the analyst needs. Read more about the query assistant in [Security Copilot in advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-security-copilot.md).

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/advanced-hunting-security-copilot-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Copilot pane in advanced hunting." lightbox="/defender/media/advanced-hunting-security-copilot-pane-big.png":::

### Protect your organization with relevant threat intelligence

Empower your security organization to make informed decisions with the latest threat intelligence. Copilot consolidates and summarizes threat intelligence to help security teams prioritize and respond to threats effectively.

#### Monitor threat intelligence

Ask Copilot to summarize the relevant threats impacting your environment, to prioritize resolving threats based on your exposure levels, or to find threat actors that might be targeting your industry. Read more about [Security Copilot in threat intelligence](/defender/threat-intelligence/using-copilot-threat-intelligence-defender-xdr).
