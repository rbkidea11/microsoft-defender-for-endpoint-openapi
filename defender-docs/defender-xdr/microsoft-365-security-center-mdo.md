# Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in the Microsoft Defender portal

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](microsoft-365-defender.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2](/defender-office-365/mdo-about#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet)

This article describes the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 experience in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>. Formerly, Defender for Office 365 customers used the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center at <https://protection.office.com>, but access to that portal ended in 2022.

The Defender portal combines security capabilities from existing Microsoft 365 security portals. This improved portal helps security teams protect their organization from threats more effectively and efficiently.

For more information about the benefits of the unified Microsoft Defender XDR, see [Overview of Defender XDR](microsoft-365-defender.md).

If you're looking for compliance-related items, see [Microsoft Purview portal](/purview/purview-compliance-portal).

## Capabilities

With the unified Defender XDR solution, you can stitch together the threat signals and determine the full scope of the threat, and how it currently affects the organization.

Defender for Office 365 safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools. Most Defender for Office 365 specific features are available under the **Email & collaboration** node as described in the [Email & collaboration](#email--collaboration) section.

> [!TIP]
>
> - Defender for Office 365 includes all the functionality in Exchange Online Protection (EOP). For more information about EOP, see [Exchange Online Protection overview](/defender-office-365/eop-about).
>
> - What you see or don't see in the Defender portal depends on your subscription (for example, Microsoft 365 E5 vs. an add-on or standalone Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 subscription).
>
>   For more information about the differences between Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and Plan 2, see [Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 vs. Plan 2 cheat sheet](/defender-office-365/mdo-about#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet).

### Home

The **Home** page of the Defender portal shows important summary information (cards) about the security status of your Microsoft 365 environment.

- Use :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-guided-tour-icon.png" border="false"::: **Guided tour** to take a quick tour of:
  - Email & collaboration
  - Attack simulation training (Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 only)
- Use :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-take-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **What's New** to go to the [Microsoft Defender XDR Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-xdr-blog/bg-p/MicrosoftThreatProtectionBlog).
- Use :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-community-icon.png" border="false"::: **Community** to go to the [Security, Compliance, and Identity community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/ct-p/MicrosoftSecurityandCompliance).
- Use :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Add cards** to customize the information on the page.

### Investigation & response

The following subsections describe the features that are available in the **Investigation & response** node in the Defender portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/m365d-investigation-and-response-nav.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the expanded Investigation & response node in the Defender portal." lightbox="media/m365d-investigation-and-response-nav.png":::

#### Incidents & alerts

Brings together incident and alert management across your email, devices, and identities. Alerts are now available under the Investigation node, and help provide a broader view of an attack. The alert page provides full context to the alert, by combining attack signals to construct a detailed story. Previously, alerts were specific to different workloads. A new, unified experience now brings together a consistent view of alerts across workloads. You can quickly triage, investigate, and take effective action. For more information, see the following articles:

- [Incident response in the Microsoft Defender portal](incidents-overview.md)
- [Alerts queue in Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-endpoint/alerts-queue-endpoint-detection-response)

> [!TIP]
> **Email & collaboration alerts** at <https://security.microsoft.com/viewalertsv2> is available in Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 only.

#### Hunting

Proactively search for threats, malware, and malicious activity across your endpoints, Microsoft 365 mailboxes, and more by using [advanced hunting queries](advanced-hunting-overview.md). You can use these powerful queries to locate and review threat indicators and entities for known and potential threats.

You can build [custom detection rules](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/custom-detection-rules) from advanced hunting queries to proactively monitor events that might indicate breach activity and misconfigured devices.

### Actions & submissions

**Action center** shows you the investigations created by automated investigation and response capabilities. This automated, self-healing capability in the Defender portal can help security teams by automatically responding to specific events.

For more information, see [Action center](m365d-action-center.md).

Admins can use the **Submissions** page to submit email messages, email attachments, and URLs to Microsoft for analysis. Messages reported as **Junk**, **Not junk**, or **Phishing by users in Outlook are also available to review or resubmit to Microsoft.

For more information, see [Admin submissions](/defender-office-365/submissions-admin).

### Threat intelligence in Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

The following subsections describe the features that are available in the **Threat intelligence** node in the Defender portal in organizations with Defender for Office 365 Plan 2.
