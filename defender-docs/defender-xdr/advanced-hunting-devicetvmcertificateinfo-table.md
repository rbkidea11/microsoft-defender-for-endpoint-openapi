> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

The `DeviceTvmCertificateInfo` table in the advanced hunting schema contains data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) related to certificate information for devices in the organization. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the table.

This advanced hunting table is populated by records from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If your organization hasn’t deployed the service in Microsoft Defender XDR, queries that use the table aren’t going to work or return any results. For more information about how to deploy Defender for Endpoint in Defender XDR, read [Deploy supported services](deploy-supported-services.md).

For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see [the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
