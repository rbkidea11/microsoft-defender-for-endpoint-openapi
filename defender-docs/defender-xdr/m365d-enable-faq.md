# Microsoft Defender XDR frequently asked questions

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

Read responses to the most commonly asked questions about [Microsoft Defender XDR](microsoft-365-defender.md), including required licenses and permissions, deploying support services, initial settings, and feedback.

For instructions on how to turn on the service, [read Turn on Microsoft Defender XDR](m365d-enable.md).

## I don't have a Microsoft 365 E5 license. Can I still use Microsoft Defender XDR?

Customers with the following non-E5 licenses can use Microsoft Defender XDR:

<a name='do-i-need-to-install-or-deploy-anything-to-start-using-microsoft-365-defender'></a>

## Do I need to install or deploy anything to start using Microsoft Defender XDR?

No, Microsoft Defender XDR consolidates data from Microsoft 365 security services that you have already deployed. Once you turn it on, incident, automation, and hunting experiences will start working within the scope of the deployed products. If none of these products are properly deployed, Microsoft Defender XDR will not display any data and is unable to take any action.

To optimize your Microsoft Defender XDR experiences, we recommend deploying *all* supported [Microsoft 365 security products and services](deploy-supported-services.md).

<a name='where-does-microsoft-365-defender-process-and-store-my-data'></a>

## Where does Microsoft Defender XDR process and store my data?

Microsoft Defender XDR automatically selects an optimal location for the data center where consolidated data is processed and stored. If you have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, it selects the same location used by Defender for Endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Endpoint automatically provisions in European Union (EU) data centers when turned on through Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Microsoft Defender XDR will automatically provision in the same EU data center for customers who have provisioned Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in this manner.

The data center location is shown before and after the service is provisioned in the settings page for Microsoft Defender XDR (**Settings > Microsoft Defender XDR**). If you prefer to use another data center location, select **Need help?** in the Microsoft Defender portal to contact Microsoft support.
