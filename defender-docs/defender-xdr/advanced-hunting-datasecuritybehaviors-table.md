The `DataSecurityBehaviors` table in the [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-overview.md) schema contains insights about potentially suspicious user behaviors that violate the user-defined or default policies configured in the Microsoft Purview suite of solutions. 

Insights cover a range of data security related behaviors like behaviors involving exfiltration, obfuscation, risky interactions with AI applications, and others. Insights are generated by aggregating user behaviors over a calendar day and comparing them with previous activity, peer group activity, or other activities done by the user. Insights also capture summaries of various risk pivots like sensitive data, risky destinations, and the like.

This advanced hunting table is populated by records from Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management. If your organization hasn’t opted in to share insider risk alerts with Microsoft Defender XDR, queries that use the table aren’t going to work or return any results. For more information, read [Investigate insider risk threats](irm-investigate-alerts-defender.md).

Use this reference to construct queries that return information from this table. For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, [see the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
