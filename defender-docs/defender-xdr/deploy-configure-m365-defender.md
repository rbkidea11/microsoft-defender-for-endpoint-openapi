# Setup guides for Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

Setup guides for Microsoft Defender XDR deployment give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying security controls for your tenant, apps, and services. 

All setup guides are available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224913) and in the [Microsoft 365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230646).

## Setup guides

Setup guides in the admin center require authentication to a Microsoft 365 tenant as an administrator or other role with access to the admin center, but guides in the Microsoft 365 Setup portal can be accessed by anyone. The following table provides links to both locations for each guide, where available.

| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Provides instructions that will help your enterprise network prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. Make an informed assessment of your organization's vulnerability and decide which deployment package and configuration methods are best. <br><br> **Note**: A Microsoft Volume License is required for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. | [Link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2223155) | [Link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224785) (may require sign-in) |

| Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps | Provides easy to follow deployment and management guidance to set up your Cloud Discovery solution.

With these features, your environment gets enhanced visibility, control over data movement, and analytics to identify and combat cyberthreats across all your Microsoft and third-party cloud services. | [Link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222969) | [Link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224814) (may require sign-in) |

These include detecting suspicious user activities and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.
