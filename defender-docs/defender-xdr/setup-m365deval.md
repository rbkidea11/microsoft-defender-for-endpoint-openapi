# Set up your Microsoft Defender XDR trial in a lab environment

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR

This article guides you to set up a dedicated lab environment. For information on setting up a trial in production, see the new [Pilot and deploy Microsoft Defender XDR](pilot-deploy-overview.md) guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

## Create a Microsoft 365 E5 trial tenant

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have an existing Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Entra subscription, you can skip the Microsoft 365 E5 trial tenant creation steps.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 E5 product portal](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/office-365-enterprise-e5-business-software?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab) and select **Free trial**.

2. Complete the trial registration by entering your email address (personal or corporate). Select **Set up account**.

3. Fill in your first name, last name, business phone number, company name, company size, and country or region.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The country or region you set here determines the data center region your Microsoft 365 will be hosted.

4. Choose your verification preference: through a text message or call. Select **Send Verification Code**.

5. Set the custom domain name for your tenant, then select **Next**.

6. Set up the first identity, which is a Global Administrator for the tenant. Fill in **Name** and **Password**. Select **Sign up**.

7. Select **Go to Setup** to complete the Microsoft 365 E5 trial tenant provisioning.

8. Connect your corporate domain to the Microsoft 365 tenant. [Optional] Choose **Connect a domain you already own** and type in your domain name. Select **Next**.

9. Add a TXT or MX record to validate the domain ownership. Once you've added the TXT or MX record to your domain, select **Verify**.

10. [Optional] Create more user accounts for your tenant. You can skip this step by clicking **Next**.

11. [Optional] Download Office apps. Select **Next** to skip this step.

12. [Optional] Migrate email messages. Again, you can skip this step.

13. Choose online services. Select **Exchange** and select **Next**.

14. Add MX, CNAME, and TXT records to your domain. When completed, select **Verify**.

Congratulations! You have completed the provisioning of your Microsoft 365 tenant.

## Enable your Microsoft 365 trial subscription

> [!NOTE]
> Signing up for a trial gives you 25 user licenses to use for a month. See [Try or buy a Microsoft 365 subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/try-or-buy-microsoft-365) for details.

1. From [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), select **Billing** and then navigate to **Purchase services**.

2. Select **Microsoft 365 E5** and select **Start free trial**.

3. Choose your verification preference: through a text message or call. Once you have decided, enter the phone number, select **Text me** or **Call me** depending on your selection.

4. Enter the verification code and select **Start your free trial**.

5. Select **Try now** to confirm your Microsoft 365 E5 trial.

6. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** > **Users** > **Active users**. Select your user account, select **Manage product licenses**, and then assign the Microsoft 365 E5 license. Then select **Save**.

7. Select the Global Administrator account again then select **Manage username**.

8. [Optional] Change the domain from *onmicrosoft.com* to your own domainâ€”depending on what you chose on the previous steps. Select **Save changes**.
