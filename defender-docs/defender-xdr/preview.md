# Microsoft Defender XDR preview features

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

The Microsoft Defender XDR service is constantly being updated to include new feature enhancements and capabilities.

Learn about new features in the Microsoft Defender XDR preview release and be among the first to try upcoming features by turning on the preview experience.

For more information on new capabilities that are generally available, see [What's new in Microsoft Defender XDR](whats-new.md).

## What you need to know

When working with features in public preview, these features:

- May have restricted or limited functionality. For example, the feature may only apply to one platform.
- Typically go through feature changes before they're generally available (GA).
- Are fully supported by Microsoft.
- May only be available in selected geographic regions or cloud environments. For example, the feature may not exist in the government cloud.
- Individual features in preview may have more usage and support restrictions. If so, this information is typically noted in the feature documentation.
- The preview versions are provided with a standard support level, and can be used for production environments. 

## Required permissions

Accounts assigned the following Microsoft Entra roles can turn on Microsoft Defender XDR Preview features:

- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator

## Turn on preview features

Turn on preview features to be among the first to try new features. Your feedback is valuable and helps to improve the overall experience before features are generally available.

In the Microsoft Defender portal, navigate to **Settings > Microsoft Defender XDR > General > Preview features**, and select to turn on preview features.

If you already have preview features turned on and you're a Microsoft Defender for Business, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, or Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps customer, you can also select to turn preview features on and off for specific services only. For example:

If you don't yet have preview features turned on, manage Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint preview features from the **Settings > Endpoints > Advanced features > Preview features** page, and Defender for Cloud Apps preview features from the **Settings > Cloud Apps > General > Preview features** page.
