### Where to find Defender Experts Notifications

- The Microsoft Defender portal's [Incidents](https://security.microsoft.com/incidents) page
- The Microsoft Defender portal's [Alerts](https://security.microsoft.com/alerts) page
- OData alerting [API](/defender-endpoint/api/get-alerts) and [REST API](/defender-endpoint/configure-siem)
- [DeviceAlertEvents](advanced-hunting-migrate-from-mde.md#map-devicealertevents-table) table in Advanced hunting
- Your email if you [configure an email notifications rule](onboarding-defender-experts-for-hunting.md#set-up-defender-experts-email-notifications)

### Filter to view just the Defender Experts Notifications

You can filter your incidents and alerts if you want to only see the Defender Experts Notifications among the many alerts. To do so:

2. Scroll down to **Service/detection sources** then select the **Microsoft Defender Experts** checkboxes under *Microsoft Defender for Endpoint* and *Microsoft Defender XDR*.
3. Select **Apply**.

### Set up Defender Experts email notifications

You can set up Microsoft Defender XDR to notify you or your staff with an email about new incidents or updates to existing incidents, including those observed by Microsoft Defender Experts. [Learn more about getting incident notifications by email](m365d-notifications-incidents.md).

1. In the Microsoft Defender XDR navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Microsoft Defender XDR** > **Email notifications** > **Incidents**.
2. Update your existing email notification rules or create a new one. For more information, see [Auditing](auditing.md).
3. On the rule's **Notification settings** page, make sure to configure the following:
    - **Source** – Choose **Microsoft Defender Experts** under **Microsoft Defender XDR** and **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.
    - **Alert severity** – Choose the alert severities that will trigger an incident notification. For example, if you only want to be informed about high-severity incidents, select High.

### Generate sample Defender Experts Notifications

You can generate a sample Defender Experts Notification to start experiencing the Defender Experts for Hunting service without having to wait for an actual critical activity to happen in your environment. Generating a sample notification also lets you test the [email notifications](#set-up-defender-experts-email-notifications) you might have previously configured in the Microsoft Defender portal for this service, as well as test the configuration of playbooks (if configured for such notifications) and rules in your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment.

A sample Defender Experts Notification shows up in your **Incidents** page with the title _Defender Experts: Test Notification from Microsoft Defender Experts_. The [contents](#receive-defender-experts-notifications) of the notification are placeholder texts, while the other elements such as alerts are randomly generated from events present in your tenant and aren't actually impacted.
