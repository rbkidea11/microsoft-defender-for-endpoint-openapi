Each row in the `DeviceTvmBrowserExtensions` table contains information about browser extension installations found on devices from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt).

This advanced hunting table is populated by records from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. If your organization hasn’t deployed the service in Microsoft Defender XDR, queries that use the table aren’t going to work or return any results. For more information about how to deploy Defender for Endpoint in Defender XDR, read [Deploy supported services](deploy-supported-services.md).
