# DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` table is currently in beta. Once it leaves beta, the final table name changes and column names might also change. The modifications are likely to break queries that are still using previous names. Users are advised to review and adjust their queries when this table is finalized. 

The `DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta` table in the advanced hunting schema contains data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) related to the [software evidence section](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-software-inventory#software-evidence). This table allows you to view evidence of where a specific software was detected on a device. You can use this table, for example, to identify the file paths of specific software. Use this reference to construct queries that return information from the table.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data populates this advanced hunting table. If your organization didn't deploy the service in Microsoft Defender XDR, queries that use the table arenâ€™t going to work or return any results. For more information about how to deploy Defender for Endpoint in Defender XDR, read [Deploy supported services](deploy-supported-services.md).


For information on other tables in the advanced hunting schema, see [the advanced hunting reference](advanced-hunting-schema-tables.md).
