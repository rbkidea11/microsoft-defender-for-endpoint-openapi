# Microsoft Defender portal

[Microsoft's unified security SecOps platform](overview-unified-security.md) combines Microsoft security services in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).

The portal provides a single location to monitor, manage, and configure pre-breach and post-breach security across on-premises and multicloud assets.

- **Pre-breach security**: Proactively visualize, assess, remediate, and monitor organizational security posture to reduce security risk and attack surfaces.
- **Post-breach security**: Continuously monitor, detect, investigate, and respond to real-time and emerging cybersecurity threats against organizational assets.

## Portal services

The Defender portal combines many Microsoft security services.

Service | Details
--- | ---
**Microsoft Defender XDR**<br/><br/> Detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. | [Defender XDR includes a suite of services](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender) that come together in the Defender portal to provide unified threat protection across the enterprise.<br/><br/> Defender XDR services collect, correlate, and analyze threat data and signals across endpoints and devices, identities, email, apps, and OT/IoT assets. In the portal you can review, investigate, and respond to security alerts and incidents, automatically disrupt attacks, and proactively hunt for threats.<br/><br/>[Learn more](defender-xdr-portal.md) about Defender XDR in the Defender portal.
**Microsoft Sentinel**<br/><br/> Collect, analyze, and manage security data at scale using automation and orchestration.| Microsoft Sentinel fully integrates with Defender XDR in the Defender portal, providing additional threat protection capabilities such as attack disruption, unified entities and incidents, and SOC optimization.<br/><br/> For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal](/azure/sentinel/microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal).
**Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence**<br/><br/> Integrate threat intelligence into SOC operations. | The [Defender Threat Intelligence](/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) platform extends the threat intelligence capabilities that are included in Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel.<br/><br/> Gather data from multiple sources to provide a pool of threat intelligence signals and data.
