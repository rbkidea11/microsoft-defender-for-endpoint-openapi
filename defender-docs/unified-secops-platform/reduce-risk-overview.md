# Improve security posture management and reduce risk

Security teams need a comprehensive strategy to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent breaches, and mitigate threats in real time.

The Microsoft Defender portal provides a set of integrated tools and solutions that work together to help security teams proactively reduce security risk.

Proactive security management allows you to manage cybersecurity as an ongoing risk, rather than series of unpredictable events. Proactive risk management helps to reduce the likelihood of breaches, minimize business disruptions when attacks do occur, and raise security awareness as an ongoing practice across the business.

## Improve prebreach security

Security teams must address key activities for effective prebreach security.

Activity | Details
--- | ---
**Protect assets and workloads** | Teams must be able to improve posture across all types of corporate resources, including devices, identities, apps, and cloud workloads from code to runtime.
**Discover the digital estate** | Discovering organizational assets in the first step in understanding security posture. Centralizing assets into a single inventory provides unified and broad visibility across company silos.
**Understand asset connections** | In addition to continuously discovering and tracking assets, security teams must be able to visualize and understand complex connections and interactions between discovered resources.
**Aggregate asset data** | Collecting data and correlating signals from multiple sources to arrive at a single accurate contextual representation of each digital asset helps security teams to understand and uncover security gaps and weaknesses, including potential attack paths.
**Get security insights** | Security teams need the ability to investigate and query security findings to understand misconfigurations and security posture drift as risks change. Over time, insights help security teams to answer questions such as - How secure are we right now? How are we doing over time? Where do we stand on mitigation? What areas are weakest? Are we protected against the latest threats?
**Adhere to compliance standards** | Compliance standards provide structured, well-known guidelines around security controls and measures. Proactive and ongoing security posture management ensures that your organization meets compliance requirements.
**Remediate security** | Prioritizing asset remediation by focusing on critical resources helps focus team effort by reducing security gaps and attack surfaces in the most important areas of the business.
**Measure progress** | Security posture improvement and attack surface reduction are ongoing activities. Consistent measurement of how you're doing over time helps to ensure that you reach security targets and maintain compliance in your most critical security initiatives.
**Continuously improve** |  Use security posture management to provide fast and continuous feedback to risk management frameworks and SOC teams.
