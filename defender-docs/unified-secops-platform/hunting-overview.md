# Hunting in the Microsoft Defender portal

Hunting for security threats is a highly customizable activity that is most effective when accomplished across all stages of threat hunting: proactive, reactive, and post incident. The Defender portal provides effective hunting tools for every stage of threat hunting with unified security operations services. These tools are well fit for analysts who are just starting out in their career, or experienced threat hunters using advanced hunting methods. Threat hunters of all levels benefit from hunting tool features that allow them to share their techniques, queries, and findings with their team along the way.

## Hunting tools

The foundation of hunting queries in the Defender portal rests on Kusto Query Language (KQL). KQL is a powerful and flexible language that's optimized for searching through big-data stores in cloud environments. However, crafting complex queries isn't the only way to hunt for threats. Here are some more hunting tools and resources within the Defender portal designed to bring hunting into your reach:

- [**Security Copilot in advanced hunting**](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-security-copilot) generates KQL from natural language prompts.
- [**Guided hunting**](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-query-builder) uses a query builder for crafting meaningful hunting queries without knowing KQL or the data schema.
- [**Get help as you write queries**](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-query-language#get-help-as-you-write-queries) with features like autosuggest, schema tree, and sample queries.
- [**Content hub**](/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-deploy?tabs=azure-portal#hunting-query) provides expert queries to match out-of-the-box solutions in Microsoft Sentinel.
- [**Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting**](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-overview) compliments even the best threat hunters that want assistance.

Maximize the full extent of your team's hunting prowess with the following hunting tools in the Defender portal:

## Hunting stages

The following table describes how you can make the most of the Defender portal's hunting tools across all stages of threat hunting:

| Hunting stage | Hunting tools |
| --- | --- |
| **Proactive** - Find the weak areas in your environment before threat actors do. Detect suspicious activity extra early. | - Regularly conduct end-to-end [hunts](/azure/sentinel/hunts) to proactively seek out undetected threats and malicious behaviors, validate hypotheses, and act on findings by creating new detections, incidents, or threat intelligence.<br><br> - Use the [MITRE ATT&CK map](/azure/sentinel/mitre-coverage#use-the-mitre-attck-framework-in-analytics-rules-and-incidents) to identify detection gaps, and then run predefined hunting queries for highlighted techniques.<br><br> - Insert new threat intelligence into proven queries to tune detections and confirm if a compromise is in process.<br><br> - Take proactive steps to build and test queries against data from new or updated sources.<br><br> - Use [advanced hunting](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-microsoft-defender) to find early-stage attacks or threats that don't have alerts. |
| **Reactive** - Use hunting tools during an active investigation. | - Use [livestream](/azure/sentinel/livestream) to run specific queries at consistent intervals to actively monitor events.<br><br> - Quickly pivot on incidents with the [**Go hunt**](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-go-hunt) button to search broadly for suspicious entities found during an investigation.<br><br> - Hunt through threat intelligence to perform [infrastructure chaining](/defender/threat-intelligence/infrastructure-chaining).<br><br> - Use [Security Copilot in advanced hunting](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-security-copilot) to generate queries at machine speed and scale. |
| **Post incident** - Improve coverage and insights to prevent similar incidents from recurring. | - Turn successful hunting queries into new [analytics and detection rules](/azure/sentinel/threat-detection), or refine existing ones.<br><br> - [Restore historical data](/azure/sentinel/restore) and [search large datasets](/azure/sentinel/search-jobs?tabs=defender-portal) for specialized hunting as part of full incident investigations. |
