# Malware names

We name the malware and unwanted software that we detect according to the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) malware naming scheme. The scheme uses the following format:

When our analysts research a particular threat, they determine what each of the components name is.

## Type

Type describes what the malware does on your computer. The following are the different types of malware that Microsoft products detect.

### Malware

Following are the types of malware that Microsoft detects. To know more about how Microsoft defines malware, see [How Microsoft identifies malware and potentially unwanted applications - Malware](criteria.md#malware).

```
* Backdoor
* Constructor
* DDoS
* Exploit
* HackTool
* Joke
* Password Stealer (PWS)
* Ransom
* Rogue
* Spammer
* Spoofer
* Trojan
* TrojanClicker
* TrojanDownloader
* TrojanNotifier
* TrojanProxy
* TrojanSpy
* VirTool
* Virus
* Worm
```

### Unwanted software

```
* Adware
* BrowserModifier
* Misleading
* MonitoringTool
* Program
* SoftwareBundler
* UwS
```

### Potentially unwanted applications

Following are the types of potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) that Microsoft products detect. To know what PUAs are, see [Potentially unwanted application (PUA)](criteria.md#potentially-unwanted-application-pua).

```
* PUA
* App
* PUAAdvertising
* PUATorrent
* PUAMiner
* PUAMarketing

```
### Tampering software

Tampering software, detected as ***Tampering** are tools that can lower device security. To know more, see [Tampering software](criteria.md#tampering-software).

### Vulnerable software

Following are the types of vulnerable software that Microsoft products detect. Know more about this detection in [Vulnerable software](criteria.md#vulnerable-software).

```
* Vulnerable
* VulnerableDriver
```

### Other malware types

Microsoft also detects ***Behavior** and ***Tool** types of malware.

## Family

Grouping of malware based on common characteristics, including attribution to the same authors. Security software providers sometimes use different names for the same malware family.

## Variant letter

Used sequentially for every distinct version of a malware family. For example, the detection for the variant **".AF"** is created after the detection for the variant **".AE"**.

## Suffixes

A suffix that begins with **!** is an indicator used by Microsoft internally.
