# Security assessment: Change password for Okta privileged User accounts

This recommendation lists any Okta privileged accounts that use outdated passwords that were last set over 180 days ago.  

## Prerequisites

To use this security assessment, you must first connect your Okta instance in the Microsoft Defender portal.  
For setup instructions, see [Connect your Okta instance](/defender-for-identity/okta-integration#connect-okta-to-defender-for-identity).

## Why is a privileged account with an old password a security risk?

Privileged accounts with old passwords create a significant security risk, as older credentials are more likely to be exposed through data breaches or other attack vectors. Enforcing regular password updates for privileged accounts reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access and strengthens overall security. Applying stringent password policies to accounts with elevated privileges protects sensitive resources and lowers the risk of exploitation.

## Remediation steps
