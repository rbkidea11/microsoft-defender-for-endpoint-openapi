# Monthly operational guide - Microsoft Defender for Identity

This article reviews the Microsoft Defender for Identity activities we recommend for your team on a monthly basis.

## Review tuned alerts and adjust tuning if needed

**Where**: In Microsoft Defender XDR, select **Hunting > Advanced hunting**

**Persona**: Security and compliance administrators, SOC analysts

Microsoft Defender XDR allows you to *tune* alerts, helping you reduce the number of alerts you need to triage. Tuning alerts resolves alerts automatically based on your configurations and rule conditions.

We recommend reviewing your tuning configurations regularly to make sure that they're still relevant and effective. For example:

- Check to see if your existing rules have matches as expected
- If a rule has no matches, consider whether you still need it or if you can remove it

For more information, see [Investigate Defender for Identity security alerts in Microsoft Defender XDR](../manage-security-alerts.md).
