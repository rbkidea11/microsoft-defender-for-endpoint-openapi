# Download and schedule Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft Defender XDR (Preview)

Microsoft Defender XDR provides Defender for Identity reports, which you can either generate on demand or configure to be sent periodically by email.

## Access Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft Defender XDR

To access Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft Defender XDR, from the navigation menu on the left, select **Reports** > **Identities** > **Report management**.

Available reports include:

|Report name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Summary**| Presents a dashboard of your system status, including: <br><br>- **Summary**: A summary of detected network activity <br>- **Open health issues**: Lists Defender for Identity health issues you should take care of. <br><br> Suspicious activities and health issues are listed by type. |
|**Modification to sensitive groups**     |    Lists every time a modification is made to sensitive groups, such as admins, or manually tagged accounts or groups. <br><br>If you're using Defender for Identity standalone sensors, make sure that [events are forwarded from your domain controllers to the standalone sensors](deploy/configure-event-forwarding.md) in order to receive a full report about your sensitive groups.     |
|**Passwords exposed in cleartext**     | Lists all source computer and account passwords detected by Defender for Identity being sent in clear text. <br><br>**Note**: Some services use the LDAP non-secure protocol to send account credentials in plain text. This can even happen for sensitive accounts. Attackers monitoring network traffic can catch and then reuse these credentials for malicious purposes.     |
| **Lateral movement paths to sensitive accounts** | Lists the sensitive accounts that are exposed via lateral movement paths, for the selected report period. <br><br>For more information, see [Lateral movement paths](understand-lateral-movement-paths.md). |
