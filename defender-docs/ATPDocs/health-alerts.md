# Microsoft Defender for Identity health issues

The Microsoft Defender for Identity **Health Issues** page lists any current health issues for your Defender for Identity deployment and sensors, alerting you to any problems in your Defender for Identity deployment.

## Health issues page

The Microsoft Defender for Identity **Health issues** page lets you know when there's a problem with your Defender for Identity workspace, by raising a health issue. To access the page, follow these steps:

1. In [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Identities**, select **Health issues**.

1. The **Health issues** page appears, where you can see health issues for both your general Defender for Identity environment and specific sensors.

    Defender for Identity supports the following types of health alerts:

    - **Domain-related or aggregated health issues**, listed on the **Global health issues** tab
    - **Sensor-specific health issues**, listed on the **Sensor health issues** tab

    Filter issues by status, issue name, or severity to help you find the issue you're looking for.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/health-issues/global-health-issues.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Health Issues page." lightbox="media/health-issues/global-health-issues.png":::

1. Select any issue for more details and the option to close or suppress the issue. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/health-issues/close-suppress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a health issue details pane." lightbox="media/health-issues/close-suppress.png":::

## Health issue status

Health issues in Microsoft Defender for Identity can have different statuses depending on their state and how they're handled. 

- **Open:** The health issue is marked as open. 
- **Closed:** A health issue is automatically marked as **Closed** when Microsoft Defender for Identity detects that the underlying issue is resolved. If you have the [Azure ATP (workspace name) Administrator](/defender-for-identity/role-groups#defender-for-identity-security-groups) role, you can also manually close a health issue.
- **Suppressed:** If you have Azure ATP (workspace name) Administrators permissions, you can suppress the health alert for seven days. Suppress a health alert if you're aware of an expected temporary known issue, for example, taking down a machine for maintenance.

For example, if a domain controller is taken offline for maintenance, a "Sensor stopped communicating" alert might be triggered. You can use the API to change the alert status from Open to Suppressed. Once the domain controller is back online, revert the status to Open and let Microsoft Defender for Identity close the alert automatically when the issue is resolved.

## Health issues

This section describes all the health issues for each component, listing the cause and the steps needed to resolve the problem.

Sensor-specific health issues are displayed in the **Sensor health issues** tab and domain related or aggregated health issues are displayed in the **Global health issues** tab as detailed in the following tables:
