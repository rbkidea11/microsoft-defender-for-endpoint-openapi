# Security assessment: Enforce encryption for RPC certificate enrollment interface (ESC11)

This article describes Microsoft Defender for Identity's **Enforce encryption for RPC certificate enrollment** security posture assessment report.

## What is encryption with RPC certificate enrollment?

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) supports certificate enrollment using the RPC protocol, specifically with the MS-ICPR interface. In such cases, the CA settings determine the security settings for the RPC interface, including the requirement for packet privacy.

If the `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` flag is turned on, the RPC interface only accepts connections with the `RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY` authentication level. This is the highest authentication level, and requires each packet to be signed and encrypted so as to prevent any kind of relay attack. This is similar to `SMB Signing` in the SMB protocol.

If the RPC enrollment interface doesn't require packet privacy, it becomes vulnerable to relay attacks (ESC11). The `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` flag is on by default, but is often turned off to allow clients that can't support the required RPC authentication level, such as clients running Windows XP. 

## Prerequisites

This assessment is available only to customers who have installed a sensor on an AD CS server. For more information, see [New sensor type for Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](whats-new.md#new-sensor-type-for-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs).

## How do I use this security assessment to improve my organizational security posture?

1. Review the recommended action at <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions> for enforcing encryption for RPC certificate enrollment.  For example:

1. Research why the `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` flag is turned off.

1. Make sure to turn the `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` flag on to remove the vulnerability.

    To turn on the flag, run:

    ```cmd
    certutil -setreg CA\InterfaceFlags +IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST
    ```

    To restart the service, run:

    ```cmd
    net stop certsvc & net start certsvc
    ```

Make sure to test your settings in a controlled environment before turning them on in production.
