# Privacy with Microsoft Defender for Identity

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-hybrid-note](../includes/gdpr-hybrid-note.md)]

## What data is collected?

Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors information generated from your organization's Active Directory, network activities, and event activities to detect suspicious activity. The monitored activity information enables Defender for Identity to help you determine the validity of each potential threat and correctly triage and respond.

For more information see: [Microsoft Defender for Identity monitored activities](monitored-activities.md).

## Data location

Defender for Identity operates in the Microsoft Azure data centers in the following locations:

- Asia (Southeast Asia)

Customer data collected by the service might be stored as follows:

- Your workspace is automatically created in data center that's geographically closest to your Microsoft Entra ID.
