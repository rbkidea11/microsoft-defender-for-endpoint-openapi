You can also export the timeline to a CSV file and find additional information about activities associated with MITRE ATT&CK techniques. For more information, see [Investigate users in Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-users).

### Alert tuning in Microsoft Defender XDR

Alert tuning, now available in Microsoft Defender XDR, allows you to adjust your alerts and optimize them. Alert tuning reduces false positives, allows your SOC teams to focus on high-priority alerts, and improves threat detection coverage across your system.

In Microsoft Defender XDR, create rule conditions based on evidence types, and then apply your rule on any rule type that matches your conditions. For more information, see [Tune an alert](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-alerts#public-preview-tune-an-alert).

## April 2023

### Defender for Identity release 2.202

Released April 23, 2023

- New health alert for verifying that Directory Services Configuration Container Auditing is configured correctly, as described in the [health alerts page](health-alerts.md).
- New workspaces for AD tenants mapped to New Zealand are created in the Australia East region. For the most current list of regional deployment, see [Defender for Identity components](architecture.md#defender-for-identity-components).
- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## March 2023

### Defender for Identity release 2.201

Released March 27, 2023

- We're in the process of disabling the SAM-R honeytoken alert. While these types of accounts should never be accessed or queried, certain legacy systems might use these accounts as part of their regular operations. If this functionality is necessary for you, you can always create an advanced hunting query and use it as a custom detection. We're also reviewing the LDAP honeytoken alert over the coming weeks, but remains functional for now.

- We fixed detection logic issues in the [Directory Services Object Auditing health alert](health-alerts.md) for non-English operating systems, and for Windows 2012 with Directory Services schemas earlier than version 87.

- We removed the prerequisite of configuring a Directory Services account for the sensors to start. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity Directory Service account recommendations](directory-service-accounts.md).

- We no longer require logging 1644 events. If you have this registry setting enabled, you can remove it. For more information, see  [Event ID 1644](configure-windows-event-collection.md#legacy-configurations).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.200

Released March 16, 2023

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.199

Released March 5, 2023

- Some exclusions for the **Honeytoken was queried via SAM-R** alert weren't functioning properly. In these instances, alerts were being triggered even for excluded entities. This error has now been fixed.

- **Updated NTLM protocol name for the Identity Advanced Hunting tables**: The old protocol name `Ntlm` is now listed as the new protocol name `NTLM` in Advanced Hunting Identity tables: IdentityLogonEvents, IdentityQueryEvents, IdentityDirectoryEvents.
If you're currently using the `Ntlm` protocol in case-sensitive format from the Identity event tables, you should change it to `NTLM`.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## February 2023

### Defender for Identity release 2.198

Released February 15, 2023

- **Identity timeline is now available as part of the new Identity page in Microsoft Defender XDR**: The updated User page in Microsoft Defender XDR now has a new look and feel, with an expanded view of related assets and a new dedicated timeline tab. The timeline represents activities and alerts from the last 30 days, and it unifies the userâ€™s identity entries across all available workloads (Defender for Identity/Defender for Cloud Apps/Defender for Endpoint). By using the timeline, you can easily focus on activities that the user performed (or were performed on them), in specific timeframes. For more information, see [Investigate users in Microsoft Defender XDR](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-users)

- **Further improvements for honeytoken alerts**: In [release 2.191](whats-new-archive.md#defender-for-identity-release-2191), we introduced several new scenarios to the honeytoken activity alert.  

  Based on customer feedback, we've decided to split the honeytoken activity alert into five separate alerts:

  - Honeytoken user was queried via SAM-R.
  - Honeytoken user was queried via LDAP.
  - Honeytoken user authentication activity
  - Honeytoken user had attributes modified.
  - Honeytoken group membership changed.

  Additionally, we have added exclusions for these alerts, providing a customized experience for your environment.

  We're looking forward to hearing your feedback so we can continue to improve.

- New security alert - **Suspicious certificate usage over Kerberos protocol (PKINIT).**: Many of the techniques for abusing Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) involve the use of a certificate in some phase of the attack. Microsoft Defender for Identity now alerts users when it observes such suspicious certificate usage. This behavioral monitoring approach provides comprehensive protection against AD CS attacks, triggering an alert when a suspicious certificate authentication is attempted against a domain controller with a Defender for Identity sensor installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity now detects suspicious certificate usage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-defender-for-identity-now-detects-suspicious/ba-p/3743335).
- **Automatic attack disruption**: Defender for Identity now works together with Microsoft Defender XDR to offer Automated Attack Disruption. This integration means that, for signals coming from Microsoft Defender XDR, we can trigger the **Disable User** action. These actions are triggered by high-fidelity XDR signals, combined with insights from the continuous investigation of thousands of incidents by Microsoftâ€™s research teams. The action suspends the compromised user account in Active Directory and syncs this information to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information about automatic attack disruption, read [the blog post by Microsoft Defender XDR](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender-blog/what-s-new-in-xdr-at-microsoft-ignite/ba-p/3648872).

  You can also exclude specific users from the automated response actions. For more information, see [Configure Defender for Identity automated response exclusions](automated-response-exclusions.md).
- **Remove learning period**: The alerts generated by Defender for Identity are based on various factors such as profiling, deterministic detection, machine learning, and behavioral algorithms that it has learned about your network. The full learning process for Defender for Identity can take up to 30 days per domain controller. However, there might be instances where you would like to receive alerts even before the full learning process has been completed. For example, when you install a new sensor on a domain controller or when you're evaluating the product, you might want to get alerts immediately. In such cases, you can turn off the learning period for the affected alerts by enabling the **Remove learning period** feature. For more information, see [Advanced settings](advanced-settings.md).

- **New way of sending alerts to M365D**: A year ago, we announced that all of [Microsoft Defender for Identity experiences are available in the Microsoft Defender portal](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/all-microsoft-defender-for-identity-features-now-available-in/ba-p/3130037).  Our primary alert pipeline is now gradually switching from *Defender for Identity > Defender for Cloud Apps > Microsoft Defender XDR* to *Defender for Identity > Microsoft Defender XDR*. This integration means that status updates in Defender for Cloud Apps **will not be** reflected in Microsoft Defender XDR and vice versa. This change should significantly reduce the time it takes for alerts to appear in the Microsoft Defender portal. As part of this migration, all Defender for Identity policies will no longer be available in the Defender for Cloud Apps portal as of March 5. As always, we recommend using the Microsoft Defender portal for all Defender for Identity experiences.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## October 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.193

Released October 30, 2022

- **New security alert: Abnormal Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) authentication using a suspicious certificate**  
This new technique is linked with the infamous NOBELIUM actor and was dubbed "MagicWeb" â€“ it allows an adversary to implant a backdoor on compromised AD FS servers, which will enable impersonation as any domain user and thus access to external resources.
To learn more about this attack, read [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender-blog/protect-your-environment-against-hybrid-identity-attacks/ba-p/3646450).

- Defender for Identity can now use the LocalSystem account on the domain controller to perform remediation actions (enable/disable user, force user reset password), in addition to the gMSA option that was available before. This enables out of the box support for remediation actions. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity action accounts](deploy/manage-action-accounts.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.192

Released October 23, 2022

- New health alert for verifying that the NTLM Auditing is enabled, as described in the [health alerts page](health-alerts.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## September 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.191

Released September 19, 2022

- **More activities to trigger honeytoken alerts**  
Microsoft Defender for Identity offers the ability to define honeytoken accounts, which are used as traps for malicious actors. Any authentication associated with these honeytoken accounts (normally dormant), triggers a honeytoken activity (external ID 2014) alert. New for this version, any LDAP or SAMR query against these honeytoken accounts will trigger an alert. In addition, if event 5136 is audited, an alert will be triggered when one of the attributes of the honeytoken was changed or if the group membership of the honeytoken was changed.

 For more information, see [Configure Windows Event collection](configure-windows-event-collection.md).

### Defender for Identity release 2.190

Released September 11, 2022

- **Updated assessment: Unsecure domain configurations**  
The unsecure domain configuration assessment available through Microsoft Secure Score now assesses the domain controller LDAP signing policy configuration and alerts if it finds an unsecure configuration. For more information, see [Security assessment: Unsecure domain configurations](security-assessment-unsecure-domain-configurations.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.189

Released September 4, 2022

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## August 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.188

Released August 28, 2022

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.187

Released August 18, 2022

- We have changed some of the logic behind how we trigger the [Suspected DCSync attack (replication of directory services) (external ID 2006)](domain-dominance-alerts.md#suspected-dcsync-attack-replication-of-directory-services-external-id-2006) alert. This detector now covers cases where the source IP address seen by the sensor appears to be a NAT device.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.186

Released August 10, 2022

## July 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.185

Released July 18, 2022

- An issue was fixed where [Suspected Golden Ticket usage (nonexistent account) (external ID 2027)](domain-dominance-alerts.md#suspected-golden-ticket-usage-nonexistent-account-external-id-2027) would wrongfully detect macOS devices.

- User actions: We've decided to divide the **Disable User** action on the user page into two different actions:
  - Disable User â€“ which disables the user on the Active Directory level
  - Suspend User â€“ which disables the user on the Microsoft Entra ID level

  We understand that the time it takes to sync from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID can be crucial, so now you can choose to disable users in one after the other, to remove the dependency on the sync itself. Note that a user disabled only in Microsoft Entra ID will be overwritten by Active Directory, if the user is still active there.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.184

Released July 10, 2022

- **New security assessments**  
Defender for Identity now includes the following new security assessment:
  - Unsecure domain configurations  
Microsoft Defender for Identity continuously monitors your environment to identify domains with configuration values that expose a security risk, and reports on these domains to assist you in protecting your environment. For more information, see [Security assessment: Unsecure domain configurations](security-assessment-unsecure-domain-configurations.md).

- The Defender for Identity installation package will now install the Npcap component instead of the WinPcap drivers. For more information, see [WinPcap and Npcap drivers](/defender-for-identity/technical-faq#winpcap-and-npcap-drivers).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.182

Released June 4, 2022

- A new **About** page for Defender for Identity is available. You can find it in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Settings** -> **Identities** -> **About**. It provides several important details about your Defender for Identity instance, including the instance name, version, ID and the geolocation of your instance. This information can be helpful when troubleshooting issues and opening support tickets.
- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

## May 2022

### Defender for Identity release 2.181

Released May 22, 2022

- You can now take [remediation actions](remediation-actions.md) directly on your on-premises accounts, using Microsoft Defender for Identity.
  - **Disable user** â€“ This temporarily prevents a user from logging in to the network. It can help prevent compromised users from moving laterally and attempting to exfiltrate data or further compromise the network.
  - **Reset user password** â€“ This prompts the user to change their password at the next sign-in, ensuring that this account can't be used for further impersonation attempts.

  These actions can be performed from several locations in Microsoft Defender XDR: the user page, the user page side panel, advanced hunting, and even custom detections. This requires setting up a privileged gMSA account that Microsoft Defender for Identity will use to perform the actions. For more information about the requirements, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity action accounts](deploy/manage-action-accounts.md).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.180

Released May 12, 2022

- New security alert: Suspicious modification of a dNSHostName attribute (CVE-2022-26923)  
In response to the publishing of a recent CVE, Microsoft Defender for Identity will trigger a security alert whenever an attacker is trying to exploit CVE-2022 -26923. To learn more about this attack, read [the blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/detecting-dnshostname-spoofing-with-microsoft-defender-for/ba-p/3352349).

- In version 2.177, we released additional LDAP activities that can be covered by Defender for Identity. However, we found a bug that causes the events not to be presented and ingested in the Defender for Identity portal. This has been fixed in this release. From version 2.180 onward, when you enable event ID 1644 you don't just get visibility into LDAP activities over Active Directory Web Services, but also other LDAP activities will include  the user who performed the LDAP activity on the source computer. This applies for security alerts and logical activities that are based on LDAP events.

- As a response to the recent KrbRelayUp exploitation, we've released a silent detector to help us evaluate our response to this exploitation. The silent detector will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the detection, and gather information based on events we're collecting. If this detection will be shown to be in high quality, we'll release a new security alert in the next version.

- We've renamed **Remote code execution over DNS** to **Remote code execution attempt over DNS**, as it better reflects the logic behind these security alerts.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.179

### Defender for Identity release 2.177

Released March 27, 2022

- Microsoft Defender for Identity can now monitor additional LDAP queries in your network. These LDAP activities are sent over the Active Directory Web Service protocol and act like normal LDAP queries. To have visibility into these activities, you need to enable event 1644 on your domain controllers. This event covers LDAP activities in your domain and is primarily used to identify expensive, inefficient, or slow Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) searches that are serviced by Active Directory domain controllers. For more information, see 
[Legacy configurations](configure-windows-event-collection.md#legacy-configurations).
