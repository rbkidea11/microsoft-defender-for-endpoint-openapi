# Security assessment: Remove local admins on identity assets

This article describes the **Remove local admins on identity assets** security assessment, which highlights local admins that pose a risk to your environment.

## Why are local admins on identity assets a risk?

Accounts with indirect control over an identity system, such as AD FS, AD CS, Active Directory, and so on, have the rights to escalate their privileges within the environment, which can lead to obtaining Domain Admin access or equivalent. 

Every local admin on a Tier-0 system is an indirect Domain Admin from an attacker's point of view.

## How do I use this security assessment to improve my organizational security posture?

1. Review the recommended action at <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions> for **Remove local admins on identity assets**.

    For example:

1. Review this list of exposed entities to discover which of your accounts have local admin rights on your identity assets.

1. Take appropriate action on those entities by removing their privileged access rights.

To achieve a full score, you must remediate all exposed entities.
