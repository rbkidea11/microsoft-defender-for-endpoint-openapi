# Microsoft Defender for Identity support

This article provides information about support, troubleshooting options, and community resources.

## Support options and community resources

### Microsoft Support

To contact Microsoft Support:

If you have Unified Support, visit the [portal for Unified Support customers](/services-hub/unified/support/open-support-requests) to submit incidents, browse solutions, and get help.

For other customers, use the support widget as follows:

### Prerequisites

It's important to know the specific roles that have permission to open support cases.

At a minimum, you must have a Service Support Administrator **OR** Helpdesk Administrator role.

For more information on which roles have permission, see, [Security Administrator permissions](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#security-administrator). Roles that include the action `microsoft.office365.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks` can submit a case.

For general information on admin roles, see [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Access the widget

Accessing the new support widget can be done in one of two ways:

1. Selecting the question mark on the top right of the portal and then selecting "Microsoft support":

   :::image type="content" source="media/contactsupport.png" alt-text="The Microsoft support icon in the Microsoft Defender portal" lightbox="media/contactsupport.png":::

2. Selecting the **Need help?** button in the bottom right of the Microsoft Defender portal:

   :::image type="content" source="media/need-help-option.png" alt-text="The Need help button" lightbox="media/need-help-option.png":::

In the widget you'll be offered two options:

- Find solutions to common problems
- Open a service request

### Find solutions to common problems

This option includes articles that might be related to the question you may ask. Just start typing the question in the search box and articles related to your search will be surfaced.

:::image type="content" source="media/contactsupport1.png" alt-text="How can we help?" lightbox="media/contactsupport1.png":::

In case the suggested articles aren't sufficient, you can open a service request by selecting **Contact support** at the bottom of the pane.

### Open a service request

After you've searched for your issue in **How can we help?** (and selected the blue **Search** arrow), you can open a service request by selecting **Contact support** at the bottom of the pane.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a premier support contract with Microsoft, you'll see the premier tag on the widget. If not, contact your Microsoft account manager.

### Contact support

1. Fill in a title and description for the issue you're facing, the phone number and email address where we may reach you.
2. (Optional) Include up to five attachments that are relevant to the issue to provide more context for the support case.
3. Select your time zone and an alternative language, if applicable. The request will be sent to Microsoft Support Team. The team will respond to your service request shortly.

## Self help

### System health status

The service health status for Defender for Identity is displayed in the [Microsoft 365 admin center - Service health page](https://aka.ms/mdi/health), under **Microsoft Defender XDR**. This page tells you if the Defender for Identity portal is up and active, if there are issues with detections, and if the sensor can send traffic to the cloud.

### Troubleshooting

- If you have a question about how something works, check whether your question is already answered in [Frequently asked questions](technical-faq.yml).

- If you have a question about a prerequisite for Defender for Identity, see [Defender for Identity prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

- For information regarding investigation security alerts, see the [security alert guide](/defender-for-identity/alerts-overview).

### Community resources

We recommend the [Tech Community group for Defender for Identity](<https://aka.ms/MDIcommunity>). This resource provides direct responses from the Defender for Identity team in addition to the benefit of shared experiences and knowledge from other administrators and consultants.
