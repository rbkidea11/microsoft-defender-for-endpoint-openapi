# Software inventory

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](defender-vulnerability-management.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan) 

The software inventory in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is a list of known software in your organization. The default filter on the software inventory page displays all software with official [Common Platform Enumerations (CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe). The view includes details such as the name of the vendor, number of weaknesses, threats, and number of exposed devices.

You can remove the **CPE Available** filter to gain further visibility and increase your search scope across all installed software in your organization. When you clear this filter, all software, including software without a CPE, displays in the software inventory list.

> [!NOTE]
> CPEs are used by vulnerability management to identify software and any vulnerabilities. Software products without a CPE are shown in the software inventory page, but they're not supported by vulnerability management. Information like exploits, number of exposed devices, and weaknesses aren't available for software products without a CPE.

## How it works

In the field of discovery, we're using the same set of signals that is responsible for detection and vulnerability assessment in [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detection and response capabilities](/defender-endpoint/overview-endpoint-detection-response).

Since it's real time, in a matter of minutes, you see vulnerability information as it's discovered. The engine automatically grabs information from multiple security feeds. In fact, you see if a particular software is connected to a live threat campaign. It also provides a link to a Threat Analytics report soon as it's available.

## Navigate to the Software inventory page

In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), in the navigation pane, go to **Endpoints** > **Vulnerability management** > **Inventories**, and then select the **Software** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If you search for software using the Microsoft Defender portal global search, make sure to put an underscore instead of a space. For example, for the best search results you'd write `windows_10` or `windows_11` instead of `Windows 10` or `Windows 11`.

## Software inventory overview

The **Software inventory** lists software installed in your network, including the vendor name, weaknesses found, threats associated with them, exposed devices, impact to exposure score, and tags. The data is updated every three to four hours. There's currently no way to force a sync.

You can filter the list view based on product code (CPE), OS platform, weaknesses found in the software, threats associated with them, and tags like whether the software has reached end-of-support.

Select the software that you want to investigate. A flyout pane opens with a more compact view of the information on the page. You can either dive deeper into the investigation and select **Open software page**, or flag any technical inconsistencies by selecting **Report inaccuracy**.

### Software that isn't supported

Software that isn't currently supported by vulnerability management might be present in the software inventory page. Because it isn't supported, only limited data are available. Filter by unsupported software with the *Not available* option in the **Weakness** section.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Unsupported software filter" source="/defender/media/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-sw-inventory-notavail.png":::

Here's how to tell whether software isn't supported:

- The **Weaknesses** field shows `Not available`
- The **Exposed devices** field shows a dash
- Informational text is added in the side panel and in the software page
- The software page doesn't have security recommendations, discovered vulnerabilities, or event timeline sections

## Software inventory on devices

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Assets** > **Devices** to open the **Device inventory** page.

2. Select the name of a device to open its device page.

3. Select the **Inventories** tab. Under **Software**, you can see a list of all the known software present on the device.

4. Select a specific software entry to open the flyout with more information.

Software might be visible at the device level, even if it's currently not supported by vulnerability management. However, only limited data is available. You know if software is unsupported because it has `Not available` listed in the **Weakness** column. Software with no CPE can also show up under this device-specific software inventory.

### Software evidence

See evidence of where specific software was detected a device in the registry, on the disk, or both. You can find this information on any device in the device software inventory.

Select a software name to open its flyout, and look for the section called **Software Evidence**.

## Software pages

You can view software pages in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microosft.com) a few different ways:

- Go to **Endpoints** > **Vulnerability management** > **Inventories**, and select the **Software** tab. Select a software name, and then, in the flyout, select **Open software page**.
- Go to **Endpoints** > **Vulnerability management** > **Recommendations**. Select a recommendation, and in the flyout, select **Open software page**. (See [Security recommendations page](tvm-security-recommendation.md).)
- Go to **Endpoints** > **Vulnerability management** > **Event timeline**. Select an event, and then, in the **Related components** section, select the link for the software name. (See [Event timeline page](threat-and-vuln-mgt-event-timeline.md).)

 The software page provides details about specific software with the following information:

- Overview with vendor information, exploits available, and impact rating 
- Data visualizations showing the number of and severity of discovered weaknesses, exposed devices, software's usage in the past 30 days, and the top events in the last seven days.
- Tabs showing information, such as:
   - Corresponding security recommendations for the weaknesses and vulnerabilities identified.
   - Named CVEs of discovered vulnerabilities.
   - Devices that have the software installed (along with device name, domain, OS, and more).
   - Software version list (including number of devices the version is installed on, the number of discovered vulnerabilities, and the names of the installed devices).
   - Event timeline
   - Browser extensions (if applicable)

## Normalized software versions

For some software, normalized versions might be displayed in the Microsoft Defender portal. For example, suppose a device has [SQL Server 2016, version 13.0.7016.1](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/download-and-install-latest-updates#sql-server-2016) installed. However, in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), SQL Server 2016 is listed as `13.3.7016.1`, a normalized version of SQL Server. In this case, `13.3.7016.1` is functionally equivalent to `13.0.7016.1`.

Defender Vulnerability Management applies version normalization rules to ensure better cross-device correlation and more accurate vulnerability assessments. Version normalization is intentional and valid, and is used consistently to streamline detection logic and align with internal data models.

## Report inaccuracy

Report an inaccuracy when you see vulnerability information and assessment results that are incorrect.

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Endpoints** > **Vulnerability management** > **Inventories**, and select the **Software** tab. 

2. Select a software name to open its flyout, and then select **Report inaccuracy**.

3. From the flyout pane, choose an issue. Examples include:

   - A software detail is wrong
   - The software isn't installed on any device in my org
   - The number of installed or exposed devices is wrong

4. Fill in the requested details about the inaccuracy.

5. Select **Submit**. Your feedback is immediately sent to the vulnerability management experts.

### Software inventory APIs

You can use APIs to view information on the software installed in your organization. The information returned by the APIs includes the devices it's installed on, software name, software publisher, installed versions, and number of weaknesses. For more information, see:

- [Export software inventory assessment per device](/defender-endpoint/api/get-assessment-software-inventory)
- [Export software vulnerabilities assessment per device](/defender-endpoint/api/get-assessment-software-vulnerabilities)
