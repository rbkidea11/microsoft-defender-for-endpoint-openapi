# Create and view exceptions for security recommendations

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](defender-vulnerability-management.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint)
- [Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr)
- [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1 & 2](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan)

As an alternative to a remediation request when a recommendation isn't relevant at the moment, you can create exceptions for recommendations. If your organization has device groups, you'll be able to scope the exception to specific device groups. Exceptions can either be created for selected device groups, or for all device groups past and present.

When an exception is created for a recommendation, the recommendation won't be active until the end of the exception duration. The recommendation state changes to **Full exception** or **Partial exception** (by device group).

## Permissions

Only users with "exceptions handling" permissions can manage exceptions (including creating or canceling). [Learn more about RBAC roles](/defender-endpoint/user-roles).

## Create an exception

Navigate to Recommendations page in the Microsoft Defender portal. By default, the page shows all recommendations filtered to all device groups. To view recommendations for a specific device group, select the device group from the filter dropdown list.

Select a security recommendation you would like to create an exception for. In the pane, select **Exception options** and fill out the form.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting Exception options in a Recommendation pane." source="/defender/media/defender-vulnerability-management/exception-button-small.png" lightbox="/defender/media/defender-vulnerability-management/exception-button.png":::

The form includes fields to identify the device groups, the justification and context, and the duration of the exception.

### Exception by device group

Apply the exception to all current device groups or choose specific device groups. Future device groups won't be included in the exception. Device groups that already have an exception won't be displayed in the list. If you only select certain device groups, the recommendation state changes from "active" to "partial exception." The state changes to "full exception" if you select all the device groups.

### Global exceptions

If you have Global Administrator permissions, you'll be able to create and cancel a global exception. It affects **all** current and future device groups in your organization, and only a user with similar permission would be able to change it. The recommendation state changes from "active" to "full exception."

Some things to keep in mind:

- If a recommendation is under global exception, then newly created exceptions for device groups is suspended until the global exception has expired or been canceled. After that point, the new device group exceptions will go into effect until they expire.
- If a recommendation already has exceptions for specific device groups and a global exception is created, then the device group exception is suspended until it expires or the global exception is canceled before it expires.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

### Justification

Select your justification for the exception you need to file instead of remediating the security recommendation in question. Fill out the justification context, then set the exception duration.

The following list details the justifications behind the exception options:

- **Third party control** - A third party product or software already addresses this recommendation
        - Choosing this justification type lowers your exposure score and increases your secure score because your risk is reduced
- **Alternate mitigation** - An internal tool already addresses this recommendation
        - Choosing this justification type lowers your exposure score and increases your secure score because your risk is reduced
- **Risk accepted** - Poses low risk and/or implementing the recommendation is too expensive
- **Planned remediation (grace)** - Already planned but is awaiting execution or authorization

## View all exceptions

Navigate to the **Exceptions** tab in the **Remediation** page. You can filter by justification, type, and status.

 Select an exception to open a flyout with more details. Exceptions per devices group will have a list of every device group the exception covers, which you can export. You can also view the related recommendation or cancel the exception.

## How to cancel an exception

To cancel an exception, navigate to the **Exceptions** tab in the **Remediation** page. Select the exception.

To cancel the exception for all device groups or for a global exception, select the **Cancel exception for all device groups** button. You'll only be able to cancel exceptions for device groups you have permissions for.

### Cancel the exception for a specific device group

Select the specific device group to cancel the exception for it. A flyout appears for the device group, and you can select **Cancel exception**.

## View impact after exceptions are applied

In the Security Recommendations page, select **Customize columns** and check the boxes for **Exposed devices (after exceptions)** and **Impact (after exceptions)**.

![Showing customize columns options.](/defender/media/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-after-exceptions.png)

The exposed devices (after exceptions) column shows the remaining devices that are still exposed to vulnerabilities after exceptions are applied. Exception justifications that affect the exposure include 'third party control' and 'alternate mitigation'. Other justifications don't reduce the exposure of a device, and they're still considered exposed.

The impact (after exceptions) shows remaining impact to exposure score or secure score after exceptions are applied. Exception justifications that affect the scores include 'third party control' and 'alternate mitigation.' Other justifications don't reduce the exposure of a device, and so the exposure score and secure score don't change.
