# Vulnerability support in Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

Having accurate and up-to-date information about security vulnerabilities that could threaten your organization, and information on steps to help prevent them, is essential for keeping your organization secure.

- The [Weaknesses](https://security.microsoft.com/vulnerabilities/cves) page in Defender Vulnerability Management lists the software vulnerabilities your devices are exposed to.
- The [Recommendations](https://security.microsoft.com/security-recommendations) page provides prioritized recommendations to help shorten the time to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities.

If you come across missing or incorrect vulnerability information for your organization, you can use the report inaccuracy capability available for both weaknesses and recommendations to report false positives, inaccuracies, or incomplete information.

This article provides information on inaccuracies that have been reported. You can use it to determine if new or updated vulnerability support has been added, or if support isn't currently available.

> [!NOTE]
> The tables may also include updates based on vulnerability support queries from ICMs or in response to customer requests.
 
The following tables present the relevant vulnerability information organized by month.
