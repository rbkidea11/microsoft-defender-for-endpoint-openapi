# Security advisories

Security advisories provide an efficient way to view, track, and monitor firmware advisories for affected devices. You can filter on exposed devices and view advisories that affect specific devices. With these advisories, security teams can take action more quickly to prevent attackers from targeting firmware vulnerabilities.

**Applies to:**
