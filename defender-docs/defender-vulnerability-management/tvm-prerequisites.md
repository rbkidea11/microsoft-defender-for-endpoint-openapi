# Prerequisites & permissions for Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

## Licensing requirements

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is available as an add-on for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) or as a standalone subscription. 

- Defender Vulnerability Management is licensed per user. Each user must have a valid license, and that license covers all of the endpoints they use. Organizations must ensure they have enough user-based licenses to cover everyone using the service. 
- Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 includes core vulnerability management capabilities. The Defender Vulnerability Management add-on extends these capabilities with consolidated inventories, expanded asset coverage, cross-platform support, and new assessment and mitigation tools. 
- The standalone version of Defender Vulnerability Management helps your security team to efficiently discover, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. This offering is recommended for customers who already have Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 or Microsoft 365 E3, and new customers.

For more information about Defender for Endpoint licensing, see [Microsoft 365 guidance for security & compliance: Defender for Endpoint](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#microsoft-defender-for-endpoint).

## Device requirements

- Devices must be running a [Supported operating systems, platforms, and capabilities](tvm-supported-os.md) with available updates installed
- Devices must meet the minimum requirements for [Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements)

## Roles and permissions

Defender Vulnerability Management uses the [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control](/defender-xdr/manage-rbac) (Unified RBAC) model, which provides a single permissions management experience with a central location for administrators to control user permissions across different security solutions, such as Defender for Endpoint and Defender Vulnerability Management.

- **Read** permissions enable your security team to view Defender Vulnerability Management data for software, weaknesses, missing KBs, advanced hunting, security baselines assessment, and devices.
- **Manage** permissions enable your security team to address vulnerabilities, manage remediation activities, and manage exceptions to security recommendations

For more information, see [Start using Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model](/defender-xdr/manage-rbac#start-using-microsoft-defender-xdr-unified-rbac-model).
