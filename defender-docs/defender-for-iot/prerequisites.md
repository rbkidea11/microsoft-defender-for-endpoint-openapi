## Prerequisites for a trial license

Before you start, you need:

- A Microsoft 365 E5 or E5 security license or a Defender for Endpoint P2 license.

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agents deployed in your environment. For more information, see [onboard Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/onboarding).
