# Site security

Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Microsoft Defender portal includes the **Site security** page, which offers an overview of the security state of your entire operational environment. The operational environment monitors all types of devices - operational technology (OT) devices and others.

In this article, you learn about the benefits and key scenarios of site security.

*Sites* represent a specific physical location in your organization. For example, a site can represent a manufacturing facility. Use a site based view of your organization to:

- Clearly differentiate security issues by location.
- Identify points with sufficient protection, or areas that need security improvements.

## Site security page

The **Site security** page gives the security team management tools to effectively understand and analyze the state of each site. Site security also provides a unified view of all operational sites across your entire organization. Your security team uses this data to make better informed decisions when dealing with security issues.
