# Set up and manage enterprise IoT security licenses

Enterprise IoT security improves the monitoring and protection of the IoT devices in your network, such as printers, smart TVs, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) devices, conferencing systems and purpose-built, proprietary devices. The security monitoring includes IoT related vulnerabilities and recommendations that are integrated with your existing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data.

## Enterprise IoT licenses

To add enterprise IoT security to Defender for Endpoint, there are two options available depending on your existing license:

- Customers with Microsoft 365 E5 (ME5) or E5 Security plans have access to enterprise IoT capapbilities as part of their existing subscription, and just need to enable it. Each license supports five devices per ME5/ E5 Security license.

    To turn on enterprise IoT, see [ME5/ E5 Security customers](enterprise-iot-get-started.md#me5-e5-security-customers).

    To turn off enterprise IoT, see [turn off enterprise IoT security](enterprise-iot-manage.md#turn-off-enterprise-iot-security).

- Customers with a Defender for Endpoint P2 license only can try out the product for free with a trial standalone license for monitoring enterprise IoT devices. A trial license supports 100 devices.

    Start your enterprise IoT trial using the [Microsoft Defender for IoT - EIoT Device License - add-on wizard](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?products=b2f91841-252f-4765-94c3-75802d7c0ddb&ali=1&bac=1) or via the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/catalog).

    When the trial ends, the trial license is automatically canceled, and you lose access to enterprise IoT security features. To continue using enterprise IoT purchase a full standalone license. For more information, see [purchase a standalone license](enterprise-iot-get-started.md#set-up-a-standalone-full-license).
