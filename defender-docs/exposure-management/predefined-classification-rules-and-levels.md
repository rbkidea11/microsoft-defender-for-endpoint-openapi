# Predefined classifications - Microsoft Security Research

Microsoft Security Exposure Management keeps your business-critical assets secure and available. Critical assets help the SOC team  prioritize efforts to maximize the impact on improving the organization's security posture. This article outlines the built-in critical asset classifiers provided by default, which are automatically updated by Microsoft Security Research teams.

You can [review and classify critical assets](classify-critical-assets.md), turning them on and off as needed.

To suggest new critical asset classifications, use the **Feedback** button.

Current asset types are:

* [Device](#device)
* [Identity](#identity)
* [Cloud resource](#cloud-resource)

> [!Note]
> The critical asset out-of-the-box classification logic classifies your assets based on asset behavior accumulated from Microsoft Defender workloads and  third-party integrations set up in your environment.
