# Review security initiatives

[Microsoft Security Exposure Management](microsoft-security-exposure-management.md) offers a focused, metric-driven way of tracking exposure in specific security areas using security initiatives. This article describes how to work with initiatives.

## Prerequisites

- Learn about [initiatives](exposure-insights-overview.md#security-initiatives) before you start.
- [Review prerequisites and permissions needed](prerequisites.md) for working with Security Exposure Management.
- Initiatives that are in preview are marked accordingly. These preview initiatives are still in development, and are subject to change.

## View initiatives page

The initiatives page provides detailed insights into your security initiatives and their progress.

> [!NOTE]
> All information shown on the Initiative pages that is related to Endpoints data is based on the user's scope. This includes, initiative scores, metrics progress, and history reasoning.

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/).

2. From the Exposure management section on the navigation bar, select **Exposure insights -> Initiatives** to open the [initiatives](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-initiatives) page.

7. You can review the following information for all initiatives:
    - **14 day change trend graph** highlighting how the initiative score changes over the past 14 days
    - **Initiative name**
    - **Favorite** indicator (toggle on/off) to display in the key initiatives banner
    - **Current score** of the initiative
    - **Programs** or workloads contributing to or required by this initiative

## Check trends

The changes in your score provide you with useful feedback about how well you're meeting the goals of your initiatives.

1. From your initiative page, check the overall **14 day change trend graph** and **14 day drift change** to track the changes in your initiative score, visually and as a percentage.
1. For initiatives with metrics, you can examine this data per metric as well.

## Check history

1. Select an initiative to open the small overview and then select **Open initiative page-> History** to view changes over time. 

1. Browse to the time table to choose a specific time point to examine.
    1. If needed, filter for specific time points.
    1. Choose the time point and select to examine the percent effect on the initiative score and the reason for the change.
    1. Select a metric to explore the change's effect further, if applicable.
    1. Open the **Changes to exposed assets** dropdown to view up to the top 100 changed assets. The status will indicate whether the asset exposure has been added or removed.
