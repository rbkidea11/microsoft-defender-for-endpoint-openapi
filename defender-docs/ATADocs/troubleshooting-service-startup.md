# Troubleshooting service startup

## Troubleshooting ATA Center service startup

If your ATA Center doesn't start, perform the following troubleshooting procedure:

1. Run the following Windows PowerShell command:
    `Get-Service Pla | Select Status`
to make sure the Performance counter service is running. If it's not, then it's a platform issue, and you need to make sure you get this service running again.
1. If it was running, Try to restart it, and see if it resolves the issue:
    `Restart-Service Pla`
1. Try to create a new data collector manually (any suffices, even just collect machine CPU for example).
If it can start, the platform is probably fine. If not, it's still a platform issue.

1. Try to manually recreate the ATA data collector, using an elevated prompt, running these commands:

```cmd
sc stop ATACenter
logman stop "Microsoft ATA Center"
logman export "Microsoft ATA Center" -xml c:\center.xml
logman delete "Microsoft ATA Center"
logman import "Microsoft ATA Center" -xml c:\center.xml
logman start "Microsoft ATA Center"
sc start ATACenter
```

## Troubleshooting ATA Lightweight Gateway startup

**Symptom**

Your ATA Gateway doesn't start and you get this error:<br></br>
*System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Response status code doesn't indicate success: 500 (Internal Server Error)*

**Description**

This happens because as part of the Lightweight Gateway installation process, ATA allocates a CPU threshold that enables the Lightweight Gateway to utilize CPU with a buffer of 15%. If you have independently set a threshold using the registry key: this conflict prevents the Lightweight Gateway from starting. 

**Resolution**

1. Under the registry keys, if there's a DWORD value called **Disable Performance Counters** make sure it's set to **0**:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfOS\Performance\
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfProc\Performance
```

1. Then restart the Pla service. The ATA Lightweight Gateway automatically detects the change and restarts the service.
