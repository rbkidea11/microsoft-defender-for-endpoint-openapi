# Troubleshooting ATA using the performance counters

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

The ATA performance counters provide insight into how well each component of ATA is performing. The components in ATA process data sequentially, so that when there's a problem, it might cause partial dropped traffic somewhere along the chain of components. In order to fix the problem, you have to figure out which component is backfiring and fix the problem at the beginning of the chain. Use the data found in the performance counters to understand how each component is functioning.
    Refer to [ATA architecture](ata-architecture.md) to understand the flow of internal ATA components.

**ATA component process**:

1. When a component reaches its maximum size, it blocks the previous component from sending more entities to it.

1. Then, eventually the previous component will start to increase **its** own size until it blocks the component before it, from sending more entities.

1. This happens all the way back to the NetworkListener component, which will drop traffic when it can no longer forward entities.


## Retrieving performance monitor files for troubleshooting

To retrieve the performance monitor files (BLG) from the various ATA components:
1. Open perfmon.
1. Stop the data collector set named: **Microsoft ATA Gateway** or **Microsoft ATA Center**.
1. Go to the data collector set folder (by default, this is "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Gateway\Logs\DataCollectorSets" or “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Center\Logs\DataCollectorSets”).
1. Copy the BLG file that was most recently modified.
1. Restart the data collector set named: **Microsoft ATA Gateway** or **Microsoft ATA Center**.


## ATA Gateway performance counters

In this section, every reference to ATA Gateway refers also to the ATA Lightweight Gateway.

You can observe the real-time performance status of the ATA Gateway by adding the ATA Gateway's performance counters.
This is done by opening **Performance Monitor** and adding all counters for the ATA Gateway. The name of the performance counter object is: **Microsoft ATA Gateway**.

Here is the list of the main ATA Gateway counters to pay attention to:

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> 
> |Counter|Description|Threshold|Troubleshooting|
> |-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway\NetworkListener PEF Parsed Messages\Sec|The amount of traffic being processed by the ATA Gateway every second.|No threshold|Helps you understand the amount of traffic that is being parsed by the ATA Gateway.|
> |NetworkListener PEF Dropped Events\Sec|The amount of traffic being dropped by the ATA Gateway every second.|This number should be zero all of the time (rare short burst of drops are acceptable).|Check if there is any component that reached its maximum size and is blocking previous components all the way to the NetworkListener. Refer to the **ATA Component Process** above.<br /><br />Check that there is no issue with the CPU or memory.|
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway\NetworkListener ETW Dropped Events\Sec|The amount of traffic being dropped by the ATA Gateway every second.|This number should be zero all of the time (rare short burst of drops are acceptable).|Check if there is any component that reached its maximum size  and is blocking previous components all the way to the NetworkListener. Refer to the **ATA Component Process** above.<br /><br />Check that there is no issue with the CPU or memory.|
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway\NetworkActivityTranslator Message Data # Block Size|The amount of traffic queued for translation to Network Activities (NAs).|Should be less than the maximum-1 (default maximum: 100,000)|Check if there is any component that reached its maximum size  and is blocking previous components all the way to the NetworkListener. Refer to the **ATA Component Process** above.<br /><br />Check that there is no issue with the CPU or memory.|

Refer to the **ATA Component Process** above.<br /><br />Check that there is no issue with the CPU or memory.|
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway\EntitySender Batch Send Time|The amount of time it took to send the last batch.|Should be less than 1000 milliseconds most of the time|Check if there are any networking issues between the ATA Gateway and the ATA Center.|
> 
> [!NOTE]
> - Timed counters are in milliseconds.
> - It is sometimes more convenient to monitor the full list of the counters by using the **Report** graph type (example: real-time monitoring of all the counters)

## ATA Lightweight Gateway performance counters
The performance counters can be used for quota management in the Lightweight Gateway, to make sure that ATA doesn't drain too many resources from the domain controllers on which it is installed.
To measure the resource limitations that ATA enforces on the Lightweight Gateway, add these counters.

This is done by opening **Performance Monitor** and adding all counters for the ATA Lightweight Gateway. The names of the performance counter objects are: **Microsoft ATA Gateway** and **Microsoft ATA Gateway Updater**.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> 
> |Counter|Description|Threshold|Troubleshooting|
> |-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway Updater\GatewayUpdaterResourceManager CPU Time Max %|The maximum amount of CPU time (in percentage) that the Lightweight Gateway process can consume. |No threshold. | This is the limitation that protects the domain controller resources from being used up by the ATA Lightweight Gateway. If you see that the process reaches the maximum limit often over a period of time (the process reaches the limit and then starts to drop traffic) it means that you need to add more resources to the server running the domain controller..|
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway Updater\GatewayUpdaterResourceManager Commit Memory Max Size|The maximum amount of committed memory (in bytes) that the Lightweight Gateway process can consume.|No threshold. | This is the limitation that protects the domain controller resources from being used up by the ATA Lightweight Gateway. If you see that the process reaches the maximum limit often over a period of time (the process reaches the limit and then starts to drop traffic) it means that you need to add more resources to the server running the domain controller.| 
> |Microsoft ATA Gateway Updater\GatewayUpdaterResourceManager Working Set Limit Size|The Maximum amount of physical memory (in bytes) that the Lightweight Gateway process can consume.|No threshold. | This is the limitation that protects the domain controller resources from being used up by the ATA Lightweight Gateway. If you see that the process reaches the maximum limit often over a period of time (the process reaches the limit and then starts to drop traffic) it means that you need to add more resources to the server running the domain controller.|



In order to see your actual consumption, refer to the following counters:

If you see that the process reaches the maximum limit often over a period of time (the process reaches the limit and then starts to drop traffic) it means that you need to dedicate more resources to the Lightweight Gateway.|
> |Process(Microsoft.Tri.Gateway)\Private Bytes|The amount of committed memory (in bytes) that the Lightweight Gateway process is actually consuming.|No threshold. | Compare the results of this counter to the limit found in GatewayUpdaterResourceManager Commit Memory Max Size. If you see that the process reaches the maximum limit often over a period of time (the process reaches the limit and then starts to drop traffic) it means that you need to dedicate more resources to the Lightweight Gateway.| 
> |Process(Microsoft.Tri.Gateway)\Working Set|The amount of physical memory (in bytes) that the Lightweight Gateway process is actually consuming.|No threshold. |Compare the results of this counter to the limit found in GatewayUpdaterResourceManager Working Set Limit Size.

## ATA Center performance counters
You can observe the real-time performance status of the ATA Center by adding the ATA Center's performance counters.

This is done by opening **Performance Monitor** and adding all counters for the ATA Center. The name of the performance counter object is: **Microsoft ATA Center**.

Here is the list of the main ATA Center counters to pay attention to:

Refer to the preceding **ATA Component Process**.<br /><br />Check that there is no issue with the CPU or memory.|
