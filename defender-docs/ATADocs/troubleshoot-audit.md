# Working with ATA audit logs


[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

The ATA audit logs are kept in the Windows Event Logs under **Applications and Services** and then **Microsoft ATA** both on the ATA Center and ATA Gateway machines.

The ATA Center audit log contains:
- Suspicious activity information
- Health alerts (health page)
- ATA Console logins
- All configuration changes*

The ATA Gateway audit log contains:
- Gateway configuration changes* 

(All ATA Gateway configuration changes are configured on the ATA Center but are still audited on the Gateway machine itself.)

*The configuration change audit log contains both the previous configuration and the new configuration.
