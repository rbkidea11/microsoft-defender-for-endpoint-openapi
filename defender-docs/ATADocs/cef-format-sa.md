# ATA SIEM log reference


[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

ATA can forward security and health alert events to your SIEM. Alerts are forwarded in the CEF format. This article includes a sample of each type of security alert log to be sent to your SIEM.

## Sample ATA security alerts in CEF format
The following fields and their values are forwarded to your SIEM:

- `start` – Time the alert started
- `suser` – Account (normally user account), involved in the alert
- `shost` – Source machine of the alert
- `outcome` – Alerts with defined activity success or failure performed in the alert  
- `msg` – Alert description
- `cnt` – Alerts with a count of the number of times the alert happened (for example brute force has an amount of guessed passwords)
- `app` – Alert protocol
- `externalId` – Event ID ATA writes to the event log that corresponds to the alert*
- `cs#label` & `cs#` – Customer strings that CEF allows to use the cs#label is the name of the new field, and cs# is the value, for example:
cs1Label=url cs1=https\://192.168.0.220/suspiciousActivity/5909ae198ca1ec04d05e65fa

In this example, cs1 is a field that has a URL to the alert.

*If you create scripts or automation based on logs, use the permanent externalID of each sign in place of using the log names, as log names are subject to change without notice.
