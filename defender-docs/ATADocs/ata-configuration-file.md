# Export and Import the ATA Configuration

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

The configuration of ATA is stored in the "SystemProfile" collection in the database.
This collection is backed up every 4 hours by the ATA Center service to files called: **SystemProfile_*timestamp*.json**. The 300 most recent versions are stored.
This file is located in a subfolder called **Backup**. In the default ATA installed location it can be found here:  <em>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Center\Backup\SystemProfile_</em>timestamp<em>.json</em>. 

**Note**: It is recommended that you back up this file somewhere when making major changes to ATA.

It is possible to restore all the settings by running the following command:

`mongoimport.exe --db ATA --collection SystemProfile --file "<SystemProfile.json backup file>" --upsert`
