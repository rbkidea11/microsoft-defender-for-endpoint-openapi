> | While deploying the Center and selecting a certificate, a "Not supported" error is reported|This can happen if either the certificate selected does not meet the requirements or the private key of the certificate is not accessible.|Make sure you are running the deployment with elevated privileges (**Run as administrator**) and that the selected certificate meets the [requirements](ata-prerequisites.md#certificates).|

## ATA Center errors

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
>
> |Error|Description|Resolution|
> |-------------|----------|---------|
> |System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Access denied.|The ATA Center failed to use the issued certificate for decryption. This most likely happened due to use of a certificate with KeySpec (KeyNumber) set to Signature (AT\\_SIGNATURE) which is not supported for decryption, instead of using KeyExchange (AT\\_KEYEXCHANGE).|1.    Stop the ATA Center service. <br></br>2.     Delete the ATA Center certificate from the center's certificate store. (Before deleting, make sure you have the certificate backed up with the private key in a PFX file.) <br></br>3.    Open an elevated command prompt and run      certutil -importpfx "CenterCertificate.pfx" AT\\_KEYEXCHANGE <br></br>4.     Start the ATA Center service. <br></br>5.     Verify everything now works as expected.|

## ATA Gateway and Lightweight Gateway issues

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]

> |Issue|Description|Resolution|
> |-------------|----------|---------|
> |No traffic received from the domain controller, but health alerts are observed|No traffic was received from a domain controller using port mirroring through an ATA Gateway|On the ATA Gateway capture NIC, disable these features in **Advanced Settings**:<br></br>Receive Segment Coalescing (IPv4)<br></br>Receive Segment Coalescing (IPv6)|
> |This health alert is displayed: Some network traffic is not being analyzed|If you have an ATA Gateway or Lightweight Gateway on VMware virtual machines, you might receive this health alert. This happens because of a configuration mismatch in VMware.|Set the following settings to 0 or Disabled in the virtual machine NIC configuration: TsoEnable, LargeSendOffload, TSO Offload, Giant TSO Offload|

## Multi Processor Group mode

For Windows operating systems 2008R2 and 2012, ATA Gateway is not supported in **Multi Processor Group** mode.

Suggested possible workarounds:

- If hyperthreading is on, turn it off. This may reduce the number of logical cores enough to avoid needing to run in **Multi Processor Group** mode.

- If your machine has less than 64 logical cores and is running on a HP host, you may be able to change the **NUMA Group Size Optimization** BIOS setting from the default of **Clustered** to **Flat**.
