## Notes
- Part of Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- **Exposure score**: Calculated metric representing vulnerability exposure risk
- **Time**: Timestamp when the score was calculated
- **RBAC segmentation**: Provides scores broken down by device groups
- **Score range**: Typically 0-100, higher scores indicate greater exposure
- Essential for understanding security posture across different organizational units
- Supports risk-based prioritization and resource allocation
- Helps identify which device groups need the most attention
- Critical for executive reporting and compliance tracking
